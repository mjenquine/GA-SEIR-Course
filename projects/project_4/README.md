# Rails/React - Group Project

## Overview

For this project you will be collaborating to make a full CRUD app built with a React frontend and a Rails backend. You will have all day to complete this lab.

## Attendance

Attendance will be taken as usual. You must be in your breakout room, working on your project from 10:00am to 1:30pm ET and from 2:30pm to 6:00pm ET. Feel free to take one 10 minute break every hour.

## Technical Requirements
### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:
#### MVP - minimum viable product

* **Rails backend**: Create a Rails backend with all CRUD operations available across your models.
	* Must have at least one model
* **React frontend**: Create a React frontend that consumes your Rails backend.
* **Must be hosted on Github** with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often!
* **Github commits from every group member** If you choose to screenshare and code together, share this responsibility so there are commits from each group member.
* **A ``README.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself/group members so you can come back to your project later and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.

### &#x1F535; Not mandatory:
#### Recommended features - choose any

* Include **two or more models**
* Include either a **one-to-many or a many-to-many relationship**
* Use a **third party API**
* What about using **graphs or visuals** on your data? Chart.js , D3.js
* **Include portfolio-quality styling**
* **Use a CSS framework** like skeleton or bootstrap
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process (uploaded to your github repo)
* **Deploy online:** Deploy your app online to Heroku and include a link to the live application in your `README.md`
<!-- * **Authentication** -->
<!-- * **Implement React Router** -->
<!-- * **Implement Redux or Flux** -->

<!-- ## Meetings with instructors -->

<!-- **Friday December 13th** -->

<!-- Your group will meet with your dedicated project instructor for 5-15 minutes to get your app idea approved. Be sure to write out what features you will need to build in order to meet MVP and some stretch goal ideas. -->

<!-- _Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time for project approval_ -->

<!-- **Before you meet with your instructor**: -->

   <!-- - Meet to discuss your ideas with your teammate(s) and choose one idea -->
   <!-- - Create the project's Github repo *OUTSIDE* of the class repository. -->
   <!-- - Create some user stories and add them to your `README.md` -->
   <!-- - Write what features will meet MVP and then list out other features as stretch goals -->
   <!-- - Make wireframes and add them to your `README.md` (or put images and add links) -->
   <!-- - Create your daily tracker -->

## How to Submit Your Project
Your project is due Today, Friday April 3rd at 6:00pm ET.

:heavy_check_mark: *One* group member should fill out [this google sheet](#) with all information required as usual. There will be no presentations.

## File Setup

- Each of you, locally, should create a new folder to house your Project_4. This folder should be outside of your class repo.
- One person should create the Github repositories.
- Everyone should clone the repos from Github into the new Project_4 folder that they've created.
- Make sure everyone has a .gitignore! [Here is a list of useful .gitignores](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

## Heroku Deployment (Not mandatory)

If you decide to deploy your app to Heroku after completing MVP, follow these notes:
* [Heroku Deployment of Rails API](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Waverider/blob/788959e951f5eb290d62c9a9f0a424d2b42deca9/unit_4/w11d03/instructor_notes/DEPLOYMENT_HEROKU.md)
* [Heroku Deployment of Create React App](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Waverider/blob/11b2e91e252eff4bb61516d5785edf295b414375/unit_3/w09d01/instructor_notes/Create%20React%20App%20%26%20Heroku.md)

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

<details><summary>List of ways to get started</summary>

* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).

<br>

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

<br>

* Create your **user stories**

<br>

* Create a **Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards

<br>

* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

<br>

* **Utilize Github's branching/merging features**

<br>

* Look back at the lessons from class for help and inspiration! You can use the search bar on Github to quickly search for keywords if you can't easily find what you're looking for.

<br>

* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version. Commit every time you have a new feature working.

<br>

* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

<br>

* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

### Where to go for help

1. Look through the class markdowns / seek out help online
2. Consult your groupmates - share your screen, debug together
3. Hail an instructor by waving in the classroom channel on Slack

In just a few weeks time you'll be on your own. Debugging is a very important skill to have and practice. Hailing an instructor should no longer be your first or second course of action.
