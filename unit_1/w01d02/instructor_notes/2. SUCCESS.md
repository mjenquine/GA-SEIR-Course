## Emotional Framing

- Things will not go as you plan<br>
![plan vs reality](img/plan_vs_reality.png)

- Deal with chaos in your head. Being confused/lost is NORMAL. No one pays you because you know all the answers. The job is about jumping into confusion and being able to find a solution.  Make a friend with discomfort

- The maximum point of learning is right at the edge of learning and panic.<br>

- This experience is a rollercoaster.<br>

## Successful students

- The most successful students find programming fascinating. They don't think
of it as an obligation or chore.

- The most successful students go above and beyond what we teach. If there is
something they feel they should know, they will go and learn it. If there is a
problem for which they think they need more information to solve, they go and find that information.

- The most successful students don't wait for instructors to hand them the answer.

-  Successful students quickly see that programming is not about learning a recipe,
it's about developing a mindset to solve unforeseen problems.

- Hard Work: the equivalent of two full-time jobs (~80 hrs per week).

- Be open and ready to receive constructive criticism

## Classroom Culture

- Open safe environment
- Take ownership of your experience
- Check your ego at the door
- Empathy
- Be courteous calm and patient with others.  Don't let the stress get to you!
- Don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday

### Mentorship / Collaborative Culture in the Classroom

- Take care of each other
- Benchmarking: some are good at one thing, others at another. Leverage each other's strengths.
- Teaching is the best way of truly solidifying your understanding of a concept.
- Your classmates will be the best foundation for establishing a professional network in tech!

## Grit

- Jill's example is being used only because of the great photo.  Her story is **not** unique.
- This is like three months of "cramming for finals"

## Common Student Concerns

- I'm making a lot of mistakes
	- mistakes are a part of life as a developer

- I don't feel comfortable with the material
	- you probably will never feel the material is easy, but you should be able to do the work
	- by the end of each unit project, you should feel mostly comfortable with the material

- I feel good during class, but it's difficult to innovate on my own
	- There are three stages to learning something:
		- Imitation (follow along)
		- Assimilation (repetitive simple tasks: homework and labs)
		- Innovation (build something new on your own - project time)

- Everyone at work will realize I know nothing
	- this is called the imposter syndrome, and it's very common
	- nobody knows everything, it's about how well you learn

- I don't "do" math
	- that's why we have the computer do it for us!
	- programming is more about thinking logically than doing equations

- What's the best practice? What's the one "correct" answer?
	- Best practices change constantly and from company to company
	- If you think properly, you'll probably naturally arrive at a best practice
	- All that matters is "Does it work?"
		- A company that hires someone with 3 months of experience doesn't really care about code quality
		- Use your time to learn new technology or strengthen your problem solving

- I don't have a perfect understanding of everything
	- Class is set up to accommodate students of all abilities
		- We create lecture notes, homework, and projects so that advanced students can have something to work on
	- We make sure you understand at least the most important concepts
	- Only the people who write the specifications for the language understand everything about the language

- I want an amazing portfolio and to complete all my labs/assignments
	- all projects will be prototype quality - they are the start of a great idea, they won't be fully featured: most apps/websites take a team and at least 6 months to launch
	 	- You will only get a few days to work on a project
		- You are learning how to build things, it takes time
		- You're working on your projects on your own and not on a team
	Remember these things and don't be too hard on yourself
		- what matters is the ability to think and that you are learning
	- don't worry about completing every lab/homework
		- this is an adult learning environment thus we have a broad range of skill levels entering the course. We strive to have material for everyone to get the most out of this class.
		- Naturally, students who have already been coding for a while will get through more labs/hw. If you are newer to coding, many times you won't get to the bonus activities and that's ok.
		- You'll get feedback on your hw - if you are struggling, we'll coach you to help you get the most out of the material and this course

	You are trying to make a career 180 in just 12 weeks. This is a massive undertaking in a very short amount of time.
	 - We expect you to work hard, but never to the point where you are sacrificing taking care of yourself
		- completing and sleeping for 2 hours is worse than sleeping and not completing
		- if you come into a new day tired and sleep deprived you won't be able to grasp the concepts as well
		- we have a lot of repetition and reviews built in to our curriculum, a lot of learning comes from practicing and repeating.
		- It's ok if you don't get something right away, or on the first day or week. A lot of concepts come together by the end of the unit.
