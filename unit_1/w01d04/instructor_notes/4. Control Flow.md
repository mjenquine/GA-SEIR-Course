# Intro to Control Flow

### Lesson Objectives
_After this lesson, students will be able to:_

- Explain why we would use 'control flow' in our programs
- Use conditionals and booleans
- Write a simple if statement
- Write an if / else statement
- Write a for loop with a conditional inside


## Control Flow

We choose a lot of our actions based on true or false conditions, but most of the time we don't think about it like this.

For example:
 - if door is closed is true - then open door, else just walk through the entryway


 This is how a lot of functionality in computer programs work:
  - evaluate a condition
  - based on that condition take a set of actions or another





Control Flow is the order in which individual statements or instructions are executed.

Control Flow lets you specify **when** and **which** lines of code get executed

There are three forms of Control Flow:

- **Conditionals** - skip lines of code
- **Loops** - repeat lines of code
- **Functions** - save and later deploy lines of code

Let's start with *conditionals*

<hr>

## Setup
1. Navigate to your `student_examples` foler for **today**
2. Create a file called `conditional_practice.js` in the `student_examples` folder to test your code.
3. Open your `conditional_practice.js` file in your text editor.


# Conditionals

We can set up a branching tree-like structure and control the flow of our code. Though, our code will look less like a tree and more like:
```
if (BOOLEAN EXPRESSION){
  // run this code
}
```
If the boolean expression within our condition is `true`, a branch will execute. If it is `false`, it will not execute. This is an example of `control flow`.

Let's say you love M&Ms, but you hate the green ones. You might do the following

- Choose an M&M from the bag
- `if` color equals `green` is `true` hurl it across the room
- `else` eat the M&M

If we were to code it, we might write

```js
// chose an M&M
let isMMColorGreen = true

// Decide what to do based on M&M color
if (isMMColorGreen){
  console.log('Eiw! I am hurling this gross green M&M across the room.')
} else {
  console.log('Yum! M&Ms are so tasty!')
}

```

Remember: In your terminal, run the command `node conditional_practice.js` to run the code that is inside your file.

Let's do one more.

Let's say we want to do something fun tonight

`If` there is a party let's go to it.
`Else if` we have coupon for glow in the dark mini golf let's do that.
`Else if` there is a sale at the mall, let's go there.
`Else`, let's bake some Speculoos cookies


```js
const isPartyTonight = false
const miniGolfCoupon = false
const saleAtTheMall = false


if (isPartyTonight) {
  conosle.log('I am going to party like it is 1999')
} else if (miniGolfCoupon) {
  console.log('Hole in one! Woo!')
} else if (saleAtTheMall) {
  console.log('When you buy more, you save more!')
} else {
  console.log('I love cooking cookies')
}

```

Let's run that.

Now let's update each Boolean starting with saleAtTheMall

```js
const saleAtTheMall = true
```

What happens? What do we end up doing tonight?

Now let's update miniGolfCoupon

```js
const miniGolfCoupon = true
const saleAtTheMall = true
```

What happens?

Do we go to mini golf and the mall?

Do we go to the mall or mini golf?

Why?

Finally:

```js
const isPartyTonight = true
const miniGolfCoupon = true
const saleAtTheMall = true
```
What do we end up doing tonight?



6) Explain what is happening in the following code
  - first, walk through it and guess what should happen
  - run the code
  - is it what you expected?
  - how can we change this code to run as expected?

```js
let mmColor = 'blue'

if (mmColor = 'green') {
  console.log('Eiw! I am hurling this gross green M&M across the room.')
} else {
  console.log('Yum! M&Ms are so tasty!')
}

```





## Modulo
_Modulus as conditionals_

The **modulo** operator (also referred to as modulus) is represented as a `%` in JavaScript. The Modulo returns the remainder of Euclidean division (Don't worry! It's not as scary as it sounds! Let's investigate together!)

**Examples**
 - `4 % 2` // 0
 - `5 % 2` // 1
 - `8 % 3` // 2

 In this course, our typical use case for the modulo operator is to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another, so don't worry if you don't fully understand what `26%7` should return.

Check for even numbers:

```js
if (5 % 2 === 0) {
    console.log('number is even')
}
```

Check for odd numbers:

```js
if (5 % 2 !== 0) {
    console.log('number is odd')
}
```

Check for numbers divisible by 7:

```js
if (49 % 7 === 0) {
    console.log('number is divisible by 7')
}
```

**Let's add an `else` to our `if` statement**

### If / else with Modulus

```js
if (5 % 2 == 0) {
    console.log('Number is even')
} else {
    console.log('Number is odd')
}
```
