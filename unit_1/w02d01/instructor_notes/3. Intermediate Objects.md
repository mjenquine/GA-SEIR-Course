## Accessing and Naming Keys Using Brackets and Quotes

You can create and access any key with square brackets and quotes.

```javascript
const goblin = { badGuy: true }
```

```javascript
console.log(goblin['badGuy']);
=> true
```

With square brackets and quotes, you can make key names with spaces and special characters, because the key is _coerced_ into a string. _But_ you then have to access the value from here on out with square brackets and quotes.

```javascript
const strangeObj = {}

strangeObj['a key with spaces'] = 999;

console.log(strangeObj)
=> Object { 'a key with spaces': 999 }
```

You would need also to access that key with the square brackets and quotes:

```javascript
console.log(strangeObj['a key with spaces'])

=> 999
```

You could not access that key using dot notation.

Square brackets are nice if you need to programmatically generate a key name:

```javascript
const toppings = {};
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    toppings['key'+i] = 'cheese'
}
console.log(toppings);
```

## Use Keys That Are Numbers

If a key is just a number, that number will be coerced into a string, which is fine.

```javascript
const nycSubwayLines = {
	1: "red",
}
```

```javascript
console.log(nycSubwayLines);
=> Object { '1': 'red' }
```

But, you cannot access, add, or change numbered keys with dot notation.

```javascript
console.log(nycSubwayLines.1)
```

```javascript
nycSubwayLines.4 = "green"

console.log(nycSubwayLines.4);
```

There is another way to access key-values using square brackets and quotes `obj['1']`

## Use variables to store a key

```javascript
const monster =  {
	name: 'Slimer',
	age: 6
}

const someVar = 'name';

console.log(monster[someVar]);  // same as monster['name'];
```

> => 'Slimer'

## Loop over an object

To loop over object properties, you can use:

```javascript
const bestTVShowEver = { title: "Lodge 49", showRunner: "Jim Gavin", year: 2018 }
```

### `for ... in` loop

Print each key:

```javascript
for (let key in movie) {
	console.log(key);
}
```

Print each value:

To do this, use the key as a **variable** within the square brackets.

```javascript
for (let key in bestTVShowEver) {
	console.log(movie[key]);
}
```
