# Combining Datatypes & Callbacks Lab & HW

This combination lab/hw (start during lab time) is designed to be a review of all the material covered the last few days, to help solidify these fundamentals.

#### Learning Objectives

- Learn common programming principals
- Practice commenting code
- Practice renaming variables to be more semantic
- Practice reading errors
- Practice combining datatypes one level deep
- Practice combining datatypes more than one level deep
- Practice using array methods with callbacks

#### Prerequisites

- JavaScript fundamentals
- Javascript basics of Arrays, Objects and Functions
- Introduction to callbacks

---

## Getting Started

1. Touch a file for each section - there are three sections - `programming_fundamentals` , `combining_datatypes` and `arrays_w_callbacks`



## Deliverables

Three files answering the questions in each section

## Technical Requirements
1. JavaScript files must run without errors (comment out things that don't work and leave a comment for the hw grader)


## Submission Guidelines

- Must be submitted before next start of class


### CSS

**OPTIONAL:** Watch this video introducing [flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqdqEiTlqF0&index=33&list=PLdnONIhPScST0Vy4LrIZiYKpFNoxgyH7J)

## Section 1: Programming Fundamentals

1. Create a file called `programming_fundamentals.js` inside your `homework` folder for today.
2. Copy the questions that you are answering into your file (and comment it out) and write the answer below the question.

#### Common programming principles

As you are starting out, there may be things you are really worried about and other big **gotchas** that you aren't yet aware that are gotchas!

Read this article on [programming principles](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=331531), focus on the following nine:

* **DRY**
* **KISS**
* **Avoid creating a YAGNI**
* **Do the simplest thing that could possibly work**
* **Don't make me think**
* **Write code for the maintainer**
* **Single responsibility principle**
* **Avoid premature optimization**
* **Separation of concerns**


**Answer**

- Write a ~1 sentence summary for each one
- Which ones surprise you (if any)?
- Which one is currently giving you the most struggle?

#### Commenting Code

Comment each line of this code and describe what it is doing. Feel free to run this code and add console.logs to help you figure it out:

```js
const f = l => {
  let es = 0, p = 0, c = 1, n = 0
  while (c <= l) {
    n = c + p;
    [c, p] = [n, c]
    es += (c % 2 === 0) ? c : 0
  }
  return es
}

console.log(f(55))
```

At first we may strive for the shortest code possible. But we really should be striving for readable code that is easy to maintain. Compare the same solution with more semantic variable names (feel free to use this one to help you figure out what is happening in this function:

```js
const f2 = (limit) => {
  let evenSum = 0;
  let previous = 0;
  let current = 1;
  while (current <= limit) {
    let next = current + previous;
    previous = current;
    current = next;
    if (current % 2 === 0) {
      evenSum += current;
    }
  }
  return evenSum;
}


console.log(f2(55))

```

**Answer with comments:**

- In keeping with one of our programming principals (write code for the maintainer): What would have been a more semantic name for this function (hint: this is a problem we had for either lab or hw and is considered a _classic_ ) - are there any other variable names or things that would make this code easier to read and understand?

- If you started a new job and your project was to expand the functionality of this function by allowing a second argument and then based on that second argument, returning the sum of even or odd numbers, which code would you rather start working with `f` or `f2`?


- Finally, the 'shorter' code style doesn't use semi-colons, except for the fourth line. Remove this semi-colon! Run the code, is this semi-colon necessary?


### Section 2 Combining Datatypes


#### Combine objects, arrays, and functions

- touch `combining_datatypes.js` and do your work for this section in this new file

1. Create an object, called `crayonBox`, that has a property that is an array. The array should have the names of some crayons. Log one of the elements of that array.

1. Create an object `bottle` that has a property that is an object: `cap`. `cap` can have properties like material: 'metal' or 'plastic', color: `blue` or `white` etc. Log one of the properties of that inner object.

1. Create an array called `receipt` that has at least one object in it. The inner objects should be items that have a name and a price. Log one of the properties of that  inner object.

1. Create an array called `apartmentBuilding` that has an array as one of its elements, the inner array should be the names of the tenants.  Log one of the elements of the inner array.

## Combine objects, arrays, and functions more than one level deep

1. Create a function `knit` that returns an object that has the following kinds of properties `item`: `scarf`, `size` : `6ft` etc.  Log a value of that object (hint: call the function and then call a property on the return value).
1. Create a function `crayonSelector` that returns an object that has an array (you can reuse your `crayonBox` object).  Log one of the elements of that array.
1. Create a function `powerButton` that returns a function called `options` - `options` should console.log a simple message like `select a song`.  Call that inner function

**Model a Vending Machine**
Model a vending machine

- a vending machine is an object
- it has an array of snacks (make 3 snacks)
- snacks are objects that have a name and a price
- a vending machine has a function vend that allows user to enter the array position (a number) of the snack and then that snack will be returned
- Be able to call vendingMachine.vend() with a valid integer to return a snack

## Callbacks
1. Make a function `add` that takes two arguments (numbers) and sums them together
1. Make a function `subtract` that takes two arguments (numbers) and subtracts them
1. Make a function `multiply` that takes two arguments and multiplies them
1. Make a function `divide` that takes two arguments and divides them
1. Make a function `calculate` that takes three arguments. Assume the two arguments are a number  ie `num1, num2` and a function called `operates` (a callback).
1. Make it so that when `calculate` is invoked, the callback "operates" on the numbers and returns the value.
1. Call `calculate` 4 times, each time using one of the operation functions you wrote


#### Function definition placement

Clean up this code, so that it works and has function definitions in the correct place

```javascript
bar();
const bar = () => {
    console.log('bar here');
}
foo();

const foo = () => {
    console.log('foo here');
}
```


#### Error reading

What is meant by the error(s) this produces?

```javascript
foo();

const foo ()=>{
    console.log('hi');
}
```

### Section 3 Array Methods with Callbacks

A few array methods use callbacks. For example `.map` - `.map` takes each element of an array and does something to it and returns a new arrays.

But what should it do? Multiply everything by 5? Capitalize everything? If `.map` had a hard-coded thing it always did with an array, it wouldn't be very flexible.

By allowing a callback to determine what happens to each array element we get a lot of flexibility and we can do some really powerful things.

Two arrays to work with

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0]

const panagram = ['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']

```

The first question is for the numbers array. The second question is for the words array.

You don't have to write an answer to the thought questions.

#### Every

1. Determine if every number is greater than or equal to 0
1. determine if every word shorter than 8 characters

#### Filter

1. filter the array for numbers less than 4
1. filter words that have an even length

#### Find

1. Find the first value divisible by 5
1. find the first word that is longer than 5 characters

#### Find Index
1. find the index of the first number that is divisible by 3
1. find the index of the first word that is less than 2 characters long

#### For Each
1. console.log each value of the nums array multiplied by 3
1. console.log each word with an exclamation point at the end of it

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?
- Can you store the values from a `forEach` method in a new array?

#### Map
1.  make a new array of each number multiplied by 100
1. make a new array of all the words in all uppercase

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?
- Can you store the values from a `map` method in a new array?

#### Some
- Find out if some numbers are divisible by 7
- Find out if some words have the letter `a` in them


### Hungry for More

#### Reduce
- Add all the numbers in the array together using the `reduce` method
- concatenate all the words using reduce

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?

#### Sort
- Try to sort without any arguments, do you get what you'd expect with the numbers array?
- Try to sort without any arguments, do you get what you'd expect with the words array?
- Sort the numbers in ascending order
- Sort the numbers in descending order
- Sort the words in ascending order
- Sort the words in descending order

**Thought Questions**
- What happened to the original array?

### Array Methods Challenge Problems

#### isPanagram

Using the following array - test whether each letter a-z (case insensitive) is used at least once

```js
const panagram = ['The', 'quick','brown','fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']
```


#### Working with data

- filter for products with a price that is less than 10, using the array below:
- sort alphabetically by product name

```js
const products = [
      {
        "name": "allen wrench",
        "price": 2.99,
        "description": "handy tool"
