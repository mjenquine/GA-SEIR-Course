# Warm Up

Let's take 10 - 15 minutes to write a function that capitalizes a word

When you go on a job interview and are given a code challenge, you'll be able to look up JavaScript methods. But you won't be able to google 'how to capitalize a word using js'. The interviewers will be looking for your problem solving skills. So start building them by imagining this is for a job interview. Work through the steps. You've got this!

```js
const capitalize = (word) => {
 // your code here
}

capitalize('hello') // 'Hello'
capitalize('howdy') // 'Howdy'
capitalize('aloha') // 'Aloha'
```
