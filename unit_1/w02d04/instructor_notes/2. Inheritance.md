## Make a class inherit attributes from a "parent class"

Sometimes we want to have a "parent" class that will have some basic attributes that will be inherited by "child" classes. Here is our parent class. But what if we have a super hero amongst us that has all our human attributes and more?

```javascript
class Character {
  constructor (name, age, eyes, hair, lovesCats = true, lovesDogs) {
    this.legs = 2;
    this.arms = 2;
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyes = eyes;
    this.hair = hair;
    this.lovesCats = lovesCats;
    this.lovesDogs = lovesDogs || true;
  }
  greet (otherCharacter) {
    console.log('hi ' + otherCharacter + '!');
  }
  classyGreeting (otherClassyCharacter) {
    console.log('Howdy ' + otherClassyCharacter.name + '!');
  }
  setHair (hairColor) {
    this.hair = hairColor;
  }
  smite () {
    console.log('I hate when my Segway is in the shop.');
  }
  const hobbit = new Character('Mr Baggins', 33, 'brown', 'black')
}
console.log(hobbit);
```
We could just copy paste the above and add what we need, but that's not sticking to the principal of DRY. Instead we can `extend` our Character class for our Hobbit

We can now add additional functionality:

```javascript
class Hobbit extends Character {
  steal () {
    console.log('lets get away!');
  }
}
const frodo = new Hobbit('Frodo', 30, 'brown', 'black')
console.log(frodo);
frodo.smite();
frodo.steal();
```

And we can override previous functionality:

```javascript
class Hobbit extends Character {
  steal () {
    console.log('lets get away!');
  }
  greet (otherCharacter) {
    console.log(`Hello ${otherCharacter}`);
  }
}
const frodo = new Hobbit('Frodo', 30, 'brown', 'black')
frodo.greet('Bob');
```

We can even reference the parent class' method and extend its original functionality:

```javascript
class Hobbit extends Character {
  steal () {
    console.log('lets get away!');
  }
  greet (otherCharacter) {
    console.log('Greetings ' + otherCharacter);
  }
  smite () {
    super.smite();
    this.steal();
  }
}
const frodo = new Hobbit('Frodo', 30, 'brown', 'black')
frodo.smite();
```

This is most useful on the constructor:

```javascript
class Hobbit extends Character {
  constructor (name, age, eyes, hair) {
    super(name, age, eyes, hair);
    this.skills = ["thievery", "speed", "willpower"];
  }
  steal () {
    console.log('lets get away!');
  }
  greet (otherCharacter) {
    console.log('Greetings ' + otherCharacter);
  }
  smite () {
    super.smite();
    this.steal();
  }
}
const frodo = new Hobbit('Frodo', 30, 'brown', 'black')
console.log(frodo);
```


`super` is another special keyword/function. Try mispelling it - and you'll see it won't have the same functionality.

# Make a Class of either Elves, Dwarves or Men be creative and share your class with the class.
