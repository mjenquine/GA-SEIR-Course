# Make an ATM Class

For this exercise you will be creating an ATM class.

It will have the following properties...
* `type` (e.g., "checking"), which should be determined by some input
* `money`, which should start out as `0`

It should have the following methods...
* `withdraw`, which should decrease the amount of money by some input
* `deposit`, which should increase the amount of money by some input
* `showBalance`, which should print the amount of money in the bank to the console.

The `Atm` class has a `transactionHistory` property which keeps track of the withdrawals and deposits made to the account.
* Make sure to indicate whether the transaction increased or decreased the amount of money in the bank.

#### Bonus

Give the `Atm` class a `backupAccount` property that can, optionally, contain a reference to another instance of the class, determined by some input
* Whenever an ATM's balance goes below zero, it will remove money from the instance stored in `backupAccount` so that its balance goes back to zero.
* This should trigger a withdrawal in the back up account equal to the amount of money that was withdrawn from the original account.
