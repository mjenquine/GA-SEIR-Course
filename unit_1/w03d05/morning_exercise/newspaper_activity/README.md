## FLYING NEWSPAPER

Make a 'newspaper' (a `div` element) fly!

## Choices
Start from scratch or start with `starter_code`. If you are using the starter code feel free to change the text or any other elements (html and css) to suit your taste.

## Setup without starter code:
1. Create a directory for your `flying_newspaper` in today's `morning_exercise` folder.  
2. Create an `index.html` and `main.css` files within that folder.
3. Using **only** HTML and CSS (no JavaScript or jQuery!), make a div with a class of `newspaper` amd  add CSS animations to make it fly like the given example!

## Deliverables

Make a flying newspaper you'd enjoy sharing with the class at the end of this session!

## Hungry for more?
1. Without looking at the source code, try and replicate as many of [these pure CSS nav hover effects](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) as you can!

_or_

2. Create some colored `div` elements and animate each one differently. Just play around and have some fun with animations!
