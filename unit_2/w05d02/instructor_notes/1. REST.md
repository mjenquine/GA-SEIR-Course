## Lesson Objectives

1. Describe REST and list the various routes
1. Create an Index route
1. Install JSONView to make viewing JSON easier
1. Create a Show route
1. Enhance the data in your data array

## URI Patterns

We want to build maintainable, scalable applications.

To do that, we want to have a plan on how we name our URLs.

Let's say we want to make an app that tracks bookmarks for us.

We want to be able to

- Create a bookmark
- See a list of our bookmarks
- See the details of one bookmark
- Update a bookmark
- Delete a bookmark

Let's take ~5 minutes to answer:
How should we organize our URLs?

## Good URIs shouldn't change

When you provide a link, it should always work.

Some URI Pain points

- version 2.0, reorganization to make the app better (while the app should improve, the URIs should be able to stay constant, if they were designed well)
- confidential/valid/up to date/out of date - how to organize?
- moving files - you should be able to move files without changing the URI
- making the name too specific/have too many details ie putting `/jane` in the URL because she worked on it. Then John takes over part of Jane's work. Yikes.

## Describe REST and list the various routes

Lucky for us, some brilliant minds have developed a URI pattern that solves a lot of the above problems. If we follow the pattern, we can alleviate a lot of pain points.

- REST stands for Representational state transfer
- It's just a set of principles that describe how networked resources are accessed and manipulated
- We have [7 RESTful routes](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/09939db6f81d654af06b) that allow us basic operations for reading and manipulating a collection of data:

| **URL**          | **HTTP Verb** | **Action** |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| /photos/         | GET           | index      |
| /photos/:id      | GET           | show       |
| /photos/new      | GET           | new        |
| /photos          | POST          | create     |
| /photos/:id/edit | GET           | edit       |
| /photos/:id      | PATCH/PUT     | update     |
| /photos/:id      | DELETE        | destroy    |

## Create an Index route

## Setup our app

1. `mkdir fruits`
1. `cd fruits`
1. touch `server.js`
1. `npm init -y`
1. `npm install express`
1. require express and set up a basic server that logs listening when you start the app
1. start the app with nodemon and make sure it is working

Let's have a set of resources which is just a javascript array. To create an **index** (index = like table of contents, lists all the items) route, we'd do the following:

```javascript
// DEPENDENCIES
const express = require('express')
// CONFIGURATION
const app = express()
const PORT = 3000

// 'DATA'
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear']

// ROUTES
// index
app.get('/fruits/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(fruits)
})

// Listener
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log('listening on port', PORT)
})
```

Now go to http://localhost:3000/fruits/

Success?

**Thought question:** What happens when you go to http://localhost:3000 ?
Why?

## Install JSON Formatter to make viewing JSON easier

- JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation
- It's just a way to represent data that looks like a Javascript object or array
- JSON Formatter extension just makes it easier to view JSON data.

Install it:

1.  Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa
1.  Click on "Add To Chrome"

## Create a Show route

To create a show route, we'd do this:

```javascript
// DEPENDENCIES
const express = require('express')

// CONFIGURATION
const app = express()
const PORT = 3000

// 'DATA'
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear']

// ROUTES
// index route
app.get('/fruits/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(fruits)
})

//add show route
app.get('/fruits/:indexOfFruitsArray', (req, res) => {
  res.send(fruits[req.params.indexOfFruitsArray])
})

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log('listening on port', PORT)
})
```

Now go to http://localhost:3000/fruits/1

## Enhance the data in your data array

- Right now are data array `fruits` is just an array of strings
- We can store anything in the array, though.
- Let's enhance our data a bit:

```javascript
// DEPENDENCIES
const express = require('express')

// CONFIGURATION
const app = express()
const PORT = 3000

// 'DATA'
const fruits = [
  {
    name: 'apple',
    color: 'red',
    readyToEat: true
  },
  {
    name: 'pear',
    color: 'green',
    readyToEat: false
  },
  {
    name: 'banana',
    color: 'yellow',
    readyToEat: true
  }
]

// ROUTES
// index
app.get('/fruits/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(fruits)
})

// show
app.get('/fruits/:indexOfFruitsArray', (req, res) => {
  res.send(fruits[req.params.indexOfFruitsArray])
})

// Listener
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log('listening on port', PORT)
})
```
