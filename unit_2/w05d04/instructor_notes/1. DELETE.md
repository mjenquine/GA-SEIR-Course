### Create a Delete Route

Inside our server.js file, add a DELETE route:

```javascript
app.delete('/fruits/:index', (req, res) => {
	fruits.splice(req.params.index, 1); //remove the item from the array
	res.redirect('/fruits');  //redirect back to index route
});
```

Test it using:

```
curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/fruits/1
```

See our `index.ejs` has only two list item fruits, apple, banana
```
curl localhost:3000/fruits/
```

### Make the index page send a DELETE request

Inside our `index.ejs` file, add a form with just a delete button.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Index of Fruits</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Index of Fruits</h1>
    <nav>
      <a href="/fruits/new">Create a New Fruit</a>
    </nav>
    <ul>
    <% fruits.forEach((fruit, index) => { %>
      <li>
	<a href="/fruits/<%=index%>"> <%= fruit.name %></a>
	<!--  ADD DELETE FORM HERE-->
	<form>
	  <input type="submit" value="DELETE"/>
	</form>
      </li>
    <% }) %>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

When we click "DELETE" on our index page (`index.ejs`), the form needs to make a DELETE request to our DELETE route.

The problem is that forms can't make DELETE requests.  Only POST and GET.  We can fake this, though.  First we need to install an npm package called `method-override`

```
npm install method-override
```

Now, in our server.js file, add:

```javascript
//include the method-override package
const methodOverride = require('method-override');
//...
//after app has been defined
//use methodOverride.  We'll be adding a query parameter to our delete form named _method
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));
```

Now go back and set up our delete form to send a DELETE request to the appropriate route

```html
<form action="/fruits/<%= index %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
```
