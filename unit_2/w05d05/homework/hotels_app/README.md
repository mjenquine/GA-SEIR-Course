# Boutique Travel Travel Boutique

You are now starting a [boutique travel travel boutique](http://pushing-daisies.wikia.com/wiki/Boutique_Travel_Travel_Boutique). Your choice in the hotels you will work with will be very small. To help give your database some structure, you'll be using the npm module mongoose.

## Resources
> [Mongoose Documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)

> [Mongo Documentation - CRUD](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/)

> [Mongo Cheatsheet](../Mongo_Cheatsheet.md)


## Activity

### Set up

**Inside this folder**
- `touch app.js`
- directory `models` should already be made and have a `seed.js` file
- make sure to export the `seed.js` file in order to be able to import it
- `touch models/hotel.js`
- `npm init`
- `npm install mongoose`

**Inside `app.js`**
- require mongoose
- configure mongoose Promise: `mongoose.Promise = global.Promise` * Optional - may or may not get a warning in terminal about this
- configure mongoURI with db called `hotel` : const mongoURI  = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/hotel'
- set mongoose connection: `const db = mongoose.connection`
- connect to mongo with `db.on()`, show errors on fail, show disconnection:

```js
// *******************************************//
// Everything provided to students in markdown start
// *******************************************//

// Dependencies
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const db = mongoose.connection

// Config
const mongoURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/hotel'

// Models
const Hotel = require('./models/hotel.js')
const hotelSeed = require('./models/seed.js')

// Connect to Mongo
mongoose.connect(mongoURI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, useFindAndModify: false }, () => {
  console.log('The connection with mongod is established')
})

// Error / success
db.on('error', (err) => console.log(err.message + ' is Mongod not running?'))
db.on('connected', () => console.log('mongo connected: ', mongoURI))
db.on('disconnected', () => console.log('mongo disconnected'))

// Hotel.create(hotelSeed, (err, data) => {
//   if (err) console.log(err.message)
//   console.log('added provided hotel data')
// })

// Hotel.collection.drop()

// Hotel.countDocuments({}, (err, data) => {
//   if (err) console.log(err.message)
//   console.log(`There are ${data} hotels in this database`)
// })

// *******************************************//
// Everything provided to students end
// *******************************************//
```

<hr>

**Inside `models/hotel.js`**

- require mongoose
- set up the hotel schema
  - name type string, required true, unique true
  - location type string
  - rating type number, max value 5
  - vacancies type boolean
  - tags type array
    - within the array  type string
  - rooms

```
  rooms     : [ { roomNumber: Number, size: String, price: Number, booked: Boolean  } ]
```
 - set timestamps to true

- use `module.exports` to export this `mongoose.model`

**Back to `app.js`**
- require `hotel.js` inside the models folder, set to a variable named `Hotel`

- either run with `node app.js` or start nodemon (caution - every time you save the server will restart, possibly causing your commands to go through more times than you'd want)
 - Expected output:

 ```
Mongo running at mongodb://localhost:27017/hotel
Connection made!
```

#### Seed some Data

- We have some starter data, starter data is often referred to as seed data. Let's load it into your mongo db
- require `models/seed.js` as `hotelSeed` (still working inside your `app.js`)
- Add the following below `db.on('open', ...`

```
Hotel.create( hotelSeed, ( err , data ) => {
      if ( err ) console.log ( err.message )
  console.log( "added provided hotel data" )
  }
);
```

- Once added, comment out or remove the above line or else your db will be populated with duplicates
- **Remember** - when using nodemon, every time you save it'll restart the server and run everything you have

- If you accidentally made duplicates, you can drop your whole database and start again
  - add and run the following line once, comment out or remove when done
```
Hotel.collection.drop();
```

Check for the right number of hotels:

```
Hotel.count({} , (err , data)=> {
   if ( err ) console.log( err.message );
    console.log ( `There are ${data} hotels in this database` );
});
```

There should be 12 hotels in the database.

### Using Mongoose to CRUD our data

#### With each prompt, complete it, then comment it out - write all your code inside `app.js`
[Mongo Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/)

### C

- Create a hotel using the above schema
  - add your mongoose command inside app.js. Once it works, comment it out.
  - There should now be 13 hotels in the database.

### R
- with each prompt, complete it, then comment it out
  - let's find all our hotels and `console.log` them
  - find all the hotels but only return the hotel name and `console.log` them
  - find just your hotel using a search parameter that would only match your hotel
  - find all the hotels that have vacancies, also exclude ratings.

### D
- turns out Hotelicopter was an April Fool's prank! Let's delete that one from our database
- Hilbert's Hotel is getting terrible ratings all it does is give everyone headaches and no room service. Let's just remove that one as well
- The hotel in the `Colorado Rockies` has been closed for undisclosed reasons. Delete this hotel too

### U

 **Note** be sure to console log the updated document ([hint](https://davidburgos.blog/return-updated-document-mongoose/)

- The Great Northern's rating is only a 3! Update that to be a 5
- Motel Bambi is now fully booked, change the vacancies to false
- Things are on the decline for the Motel in `'White Bay, Oregon'`, change the rating to 2

## Hungry for More (choose any)
- install express
- create an app.get route that `res.send` all the hotels to the browsers to be viewed as json
- create a route '/:id' that takes the hotel id as a parameter and then displays just the hotel with the matching id
<br>

- Don't need express for the following:
  - update the prices of each of the rooms at Fawlty Towers
  - find the hotel with an `indoor pool` as a tag
  - The PR firm for the Hyperion Hotel has demanded that 'crime' is taken off as a keyword, remove that keyword


## Wildly Ravenous For Even More
- Use EJS to make views of your data
