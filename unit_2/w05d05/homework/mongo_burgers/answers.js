// create 5 burgers (at least 3 should be beef)

// find one and update the first burger with cheese to have a property of 'double cheese'


// find the burger you updated to have double cheese


// find and update all the beef burgers to be 'veggie'


// delete one of your veggie burgers
// WRONG - dELETES ALL : db.burger.remove({meat: 'veggie'})

//true

// drop the database

// add a topping of 'eggs' to all the beef burgers
//note since this db is 'reset' there should be no veggie burgers, all beef burgers should still be intact

//Add a price to each burger, start with $5.00 for each burger
