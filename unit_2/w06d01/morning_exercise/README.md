# Recursion

♻️ To understand recursion, you must understand recursion ♻️


## Recursion definition

A function that calls itself is called recursive.

A recursive function calls itself to reduce a larger problem into a smaller one until it can be solved.

A recursive function must have two properties
1. a simple base case (or cases) - which is a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
2. A set of rules that reduce all other cases towards the base case

Recursion is found in mathematics and can look really scary. But we can use recursion with ease.



## Recursion Example #1

Let’s think about adding the following numbers

1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9 ,10


### Solving it by hand
Average humans, do not add all the numbers all at once.  We add two numbers together, store that number, and then add the next number, until we are left with one number. When we have one number, that is our answer.

So we do:
```
1  + 2   = 3
3  + 3   = 6
6  + 4   = 10
10 + 5   = 15
15 + 6   = 21
21 + 7   = 28
28 + 8   = 36
36 + 9   = 45
45 + 1   = 55
55 + no numbers left means our answer is 55
```

### Solving it recursively
We can express this with a recursive function that follows our above pattern really easily

1. First, since we have a list of numbers (our test case), let’s express them as an array
2. Second, define a function

```js
const numsToSum = [ 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9 ,10 ];

const sumNumbers = ( numsArr ) => {

}
```

3. we need a base case

```js
const sumNumbers = ( numsArr ) => {
 if ( numsArr.length === 0 ){
 return sum;
 }
}
```

4. Holding onto our sum value

We have to define our sum variable and we have to be able to access it over and over again, let’s pass it in our function
If it isn’t defined, let’s give it a value of 0, otherwise it will equal the sum of the previous numbers.

```js
const sumNumbers = ( numsArr , sum ) => {
sum = sum || 0;
 if  (numsArr.length === 0 ){
 return sum;
 }
}
```

5. Define a way (or rules) to decrease our complex problem down to the base case <br>
Each time we add a number we have to remove it from the array, thus decreasing the array length and bring us closer to our base case. We’ll use the `shift()` method so it is taking the number from the start of the array, to match our previous calculations, but one could just as easily use `.pop()`

```js
const sumNumbers = ( numsArr , sum) => {
sum = sum || 0;
 if (numsArr.length === 0){
 return sum;
 }
 sum += numsArr.shift();
}
```

6.  Now that we’ve established our base case and a way to get down to our base case, we can now call our function

```js
const sumNumbers = ( numsArr , sum) => {
sum = sum || 0;
 if (numsArr.length === 0){
 return sum;
 }
 sum += numsArr.shift();
return sumNumbers ( numsArr , sum );
}
```
7. Let’s test it!

```
sumNumbers (numsToSum);

```

## Recursion Example #2

We can figure out if a positive integer is even or odd, if we keep subtracting 2 from the number.
If the value 0 is reached, the number is even.
If the value 1 is reached, the number is odd.

```
6
6 - 2 = 4
4 - 2 = 2
2 - 2 = 0
0 means the number is even

5
5 - 2 = 3
3 - 2 = 1
1 means the number is odd
```


Let's follow our steps above to write this recursive function

1. define a number/test case
Let's go with `10`

2. define a function

```js
const testCase1 = 10;
const isEven = ( num ) => {

}
```

3. Define our base case(s)

```js
const testCase1 = 10;
const isEven = ( num ) => {
  if ( num === 0 ) {
    return "the number is even";
  }
  if ( num === 1 ){
    return "the number is odd";
  }
}
```

4. We're going to 'hold on' to our progress a little differently this time, we're just going to keep calling the function with the num - 2 over and over again.
5. This will also define the rules to decrease our complex problem down to our base case
6. And call our function!

```js
const testCase1 = 10;
const isEven = ( num ) => {
  if ( num === 0 ) {
    return "the number is even";
  }
  if ( num === 1 ){
    return "the number is odd";
  }
  return isEven( num - 2 );
}
```

7. Let's test it!

```js
isEven( testCase1 );
isEven( 101 );
```

## Your turn

Sometimes, it is scary to do things that might cause an infinite loop or blow the stack- because it may be difficult to stop and cause your computer to freeze and you might have to restart it.

[repl.it](https://repl.it/) is really nice because if you cause an infinite loop or try to blow the stack it'll stop pretty quickly and give you an error. You are welcome to do this in node, but if you are afraid of creating infinite loops, go on over to `repl.it` and get coding there.

### Factorial

The factorial of a positive integer, n, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to to n.

The factorial of 5 is 120
> 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

Write a recursive function `factorial` that returns the factorial of a given number

Remember, you can get started with Karolin's 7 easy steps to writing a recursive function

1. Establish a test case (for this example, you can choose 5, since we know the result will be 120)
2. Write an empty function
3. Define your base case(s) - What is our base case for this problem?
4. Figure out how you will 'hold on' to your progress as you call the funtion again and again
5. Define a way to reduce your complex case down to the base case (you may be able to combine step 4 into this)
6. Call your function inside your function
7. Test it!

### Step Counting

Suppose you want climb a staircase of N steps, and on each step you can take either 1 or 2 steps. How many distinct ways are there to climb the staircase? For example, if you wanted to climb 4 steps, you can take the following distinct number of steps:

```
1) 1, 1, 1, 1
2) 1, 1, 2
3) 1, 2, 1
4) 2, 1, 1
5) 2, 2
```

So there are 5 distinct ways to climb 4 steps. We want to write a function, using recursion, that will produce the answer for any number of steps.

### Fibonacci Sequence

Fibonacci sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integers in which the first and second terms are both equal to 1 and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding it. The first few terms are $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,...

Write a function where you take a number and determine whether or not it is a Fibonacci number (return true/false)

**Note** : This is a popular recursion problem that comes up often

### Recursion "Branches"

Consider this puzzle: by starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite amount of new numbers can be produced. How would you write a function that, given a number, tries to find a sequence of such additions and multiplications that produce that number? For example, the number 13 could be reached by first multiplying by 3 and then adding 5 twice, whereas the number 15 cannot be reached at all.

### Hungry for More


#### Array Flattener

Create a function that takes a multi-level array (of any depth) and flattens it to one level

```
const arr = [1 ,2 ,[3 ,4, [5,[6]],7],8, [9, 10]];

flatten (arr);

// [ 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9 ,10 ];

```

#### Total Recall

It is now time to push you understanding of functional programming to
the next level. Write a function `recall(word)` which can be chain
called like so

```javascript
recall(‘Sorry,’)(‘Your’)(‘whole’)(‘life’)(‘is’)(‘just’)(‘a’)(‘dream.’)(‘I’)(‘have’)(‘been’)(‘trying’)(‘to’)(‘tell’)(‘you,’)(‘someone’)(‘has’)(‘erased’)(‘your’)(‘memory.’)();

// => “Sorry, Your whole life is just a dream. I have been trying to tell you, someone has erased your memory. ”
```

Notice that if you pass a string as an argument the function *saves*
it. If you invoke it with no argument at the end it will log to the
console all of the previous arguments concatenated together.
