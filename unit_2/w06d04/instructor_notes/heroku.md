## New Github Repository

This is going to be a porfolio piece so you'll want it hosted on regular [github](https://github.com/).

Make a new repo! Click the + on the upper right navigation bar

![new repo](https://i.imgur.com/Y3IF2lF.png)

<br>

**Choose**
- a repository name
- public (let your instructors help you if you get stuck, you can always change this later)
- initialize with a README
- `Add .gitignore` scroll down and choose Node
- license - optional

Press the `Create Repository` button when you're ready!

## Clone Your New Repository to Your Computer
**In Terminal**
- navigate OUTSIDE the class repository
- check you are not already in a git repository
	- **GOOD** -

	![not a repo](https://i.imgur.com/9wxsCNd.png)

	- **BAD**  -

	find a new location for your project!


	![already a repo](https://i.imgur.com/dAxjl7t.png)

**On Github**
- click the `Clone or Download` button
- check if you are grabbing the right url for `https` or `ssh`
- click the clipboard button

![clone or download](https://i.imgur.com/zeWKOXk.png)

**In Terminal**
type `git clone` and then paste the URL that you copied from github

Should look something like this

![clone command in terminal](https://i.imgur.com/u43zNsF.png)

- **Important!** Don't forget to cd into your new directory/repo!
- `ls -a` - you should see your `README.md` and `.gitignore` that you created on github

## Basic Express App

Let's build a basic express app

- `touch server.js`
- `npm init`
- `npm install express mongoose method-override`

Check out `package.json` make sure everything looks as expected

![package.json](https://i.imgur.com/T1cwlmY.png)

<hr>

## Set the Node Engine

[You should always specify a Node.js version that matches the runtime you're developing and testing with](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support). Without setting this, Heroku will 'guess' a version Node.js for you. One big gotcha is that some newer/updated npm packages just won't run on an older version of Node.js and vice versa.

So let's set the correct version:

**In Terminal**

```bash
node --version
```
The line returned is the version, currently, I have `v10.11.0`, but you should set it to whatever your version is.

In package.json, you can add `engines` anywhere, just make sure you don't break the JSON format. In this example we are putting it between the auto-generated version and description fields. Don't forget double quotes and a `,`

```json
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "engines": {
    "node": "10.11.0"
  },
  "description": "",
```

**in server.js**

```js
//___________________
//Dependencies
//___________________
const express = require('express');
const methodOverride  = require('method-override');
const mongoose = require ('mongoose');
const app = express ();
const db = mongoose.connection;
//___________________
//Port
//___________________
// Allow use of Heroku's port or your own local port, depending on the environment
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

//___________________
//Database
//___________________
// How to connect to the database either via heroku or locally
const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost/'+ `YOUR DATABASE NAME`;

// Connect to Mongo
mongoose.connect(MONGODB_URI ,  { useNewUrlParser: true});

// Error / success
db.on('error', (err) => console.log(err.message + ' is Mongod not running?'));
db.on('connected', () => console.log('mongo connected: ', MONGODB_URI));
db.on('disconnected', () => console.log('mongo disconnected'));

// open the connection to mongo
db.on('open' , ()=>{});

//___________________
//Middleware
//___________________

//use public folder for static assets
app.use(express.static('public'));

// populates req.body with parsed info from forms - if no data from forms will return an empty object {}
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));// extended: false - does not allow nested objects in query strings
app.use(express.json());// returns middleware that only parses JSON - may or may not need it depending on your project

//use method override
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));// allow POST, PUT and DELETE from a form


//___________________
// Routes
//___________________
//localhost:3000
app.get('/' , (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

//___________________
//Listener
//___________________
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log( 'Listening on port:', PORT));

```

## Test your app

- If your express app doesn't run locally it definitely won't run on Heroku!
- test it out and fix any bugs



## git add/git commit
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m 'first commit'`
- `git push origin master`

Check this step carefully! Make sure `node_modules` are **NOT** on github!! If they made it to github, that means they are not being ignored by `.gitignore`. If you don't properly ignore them now you'll have massive headaches with heroku later!


<hr>


## If You Need to Remove `node_modules`

In order for heroku to work, you can't have `node_modules` in your repo.  Instead, heroku will add this dir itself!

1. go to local repo dir
1. `rm -r node_modules`
1. git: add, commit, push
1. `touch .gitignore`
1. `atom .gitignore`
1. add a line that says just `node_modules` to .gitignore
1. save .gitignore
1. git: add, commit, push
1. to get it working locally again: `npm install`


<hr>


## Get started with Heroku

- [Sign up for Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/)
	- You may need a CC at some point although you will not be charged
- [Install Heroku CLI Tools](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
	- Verify by typing `heroku login` anywhere in your terminal
	- Follow prompts to sync up your heroku credentials, DO NOT HEROKU CREATE yet.


<hr>


## Create an app on heroku

- Once you have Heroku CLI, you can access terminal commands to heroku.
- Let's start by creating an app on heroku. If you don't yet have a name for your app it's ok, you can change it later (just make sure you update your git remotes too)
	- `heroku create [unique name]` from your project's root directory where you first initialized git.
	This will check heroku to see if the app name exists, if so you'll get an error message and have to try again.
	- If you don't specify a name, heroku will generate a unique name for you. There names are pretty cool and somewhat thematic so feel free to do either.
	- You can also do this step off their website if you want but since you'll be working in terminal anyway, might as well just do it through terminal.
	- Notice that if you successfully created a heroku app, you can see that the heroku remote was automatically added to your project's repo. Confirm this by typing `git remote -v`, you should see `origin` as well as `heroku`.

## Attach mongolab addon

Now that you've partitioned an app on heroku's side, you need to attach a free addon called mongolab (mLab). Mongolab provides you with heroku's version of mongodb. Up until now, we've just been using express on local connecting to our local mongodb. Now we need to connect our heroku app onto heroku's version of mongodb.
- Go to heroku and login, then hit personal apps (https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), click on your new app, then click on the resources tab.
	- Search for mLab and add the free version `Sandbox`.

<hr>


## Push Git

- First update your remote repo so you're code is up to date.
	- `git add -A`
	- `git commit -m "updating code for heroku"`
	- `git push origin master`
- Now also push to heroku
	- `git push heroku master`

Wait 1 minute then type `heroku open`. You should have your deployed app open up in your browser.

- If thing's don't work out, relax and try to find out the error.
- `heroku logs`

## Troubleshooting

<hr>

### Having weird errors?

<hr>

#### Heroku Can't Figure Out Your Language

- the hidden folder `.git` and `package.json` MUST be on the same level in your directory (the root)
- if it is a Rails app, `.git` and `GemFile` MUST be on the same level in your directory (the root)
- move your files up to `.git` accordingly

<hr>

#### Check that your have ignored node modules

Your node modules should NOT appear on github

![no node modules](https://i.imgur.com/PVYeHAf.png)

If you have not ignored your node modules, follow the steps listed above to remove and ignore them


<hr>

#### Heroku recommends setting the proper node version

[scroll down for an example](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs)


<hr>

#### Check that your config variables match

In heroku, under your app and its settings, `Reveal Config Vars`

![reveal config vars](https://i.imgur.com/HyPWKAq.png)

In the above example -

In your own app, make sure you have your mongo uri equal to `process.env` and then `.MONGODB_URI`

`const mongoURI = process.env.MONGODB_URI`

It won't work if you make it a different variable name (lowercase, no underscore) - do not change it in heroku! If you cange it in heroku you'll have to hunt how to update more things. Just set it in your own app.

Note: your the variable for the port is not listed, but it must be `PORT` all caps. It is accessed by `process.env.PORT`

<hr>

<hr>

#### You Need to Add More Config Variables

Using the NPM package `dotenv`? If you've added new variables, like `SECRET`, be sure to add those custum config variables
- In heroku, under your app and its settings, `Reveal Config Vars`

Otherwise you might be looking at a `Internal server error`

![reveal config vars](https://i.imgur.com/HyPWKAq.png)

You must make the variable names match.

#### You changed your heroku URL

If you changed your app name, you'll have to update the git remote url. Get the right url from heroku (see towards the bottom

![right url](https://i.imgur.com/gU905lY.png)

In terminal, in your repo
- `git remote -v` (should have origin and heroku)
- `git remote remove heroku`
- `git remote add heroku whateverURLherokuListed`

<hr>


### You changed your github project name

![changed github project name](https://i.imgur.com/NOZ16yV.png)

Go back to the main code view and grab the url from the clone or download button

![git clone](https://i.imgur.com/TDZAWNl.png)

- `git remote -v` (should have origin and heroku)
- `git remote remove origin`
- `git remote add origin whateverURLgithubListed`


<hr>

#### Cannot read filetype MIME re: CSS file
- your CSS file is not linked properly/cannot be found/named incorrectly (working locally? see next issue)
- you have a mismatch in opening/closing HTML tags



<hr>

#### Cannot find a file but it is there??? You think you might have changed it?

There is weirdness. If you had named your file `Index.html` and then changed it to `index.html` git, by default, will ignore this change.

Locally, you'll see `index.html` (your updated name). But if you go to github, you'll see it's still `Index.html`. This will 'confuse' heroku as well.

First try to use git to change the name:

```bash
git mv -f Index.html index.html
```

Success?

![changed file name](https://i.imgur.com/hvqvkTR.png)

go ahead and `git add .` `git commit -m 'file name changed'`

If that fails,
- `touch tempfile`,
- copy paste your code from the offending file in there
- `rm` the offending file
- `git add .` `git commit -m 'removed Index.html`
- `touch index.html`
- `git add .` `git commit -m 'added index.html`


<hr>


#### The data from your database is not in sync with your heroku version

git/github/heroku does **NOT** track and sync things in your database. Your local version and heroku are two separate instances and you cannot sync them with git.

You must add/change things manually.

mLab has a nice GUI, where you can make changes

![mLab](https://i.imgur.com/SwAZxAb.png)

On the other hand, Postgres does not. You must connect to it via heroku ie `heroku pg:psql`
