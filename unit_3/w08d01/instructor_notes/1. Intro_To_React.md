 ### What is React

 [Reference](https://generalassemb.ly/coding/full-stack-web-development/beginners-guide-react)

We've already been building web sites based on data. We've been using server-side rendering with a template engine (ie `EJS`). While there are many upsides to server-side rendering, there are some down sides.
- it can be cumbersome to maintain, when you want to change one thing, you have to change things across many files
- your data is tightly coupled with your view of the data (embedding our data inside of HTML using `EJS`)
- every view requires a page reload, which can get slow for the user and can be demanding on the server (imagine thousands or millions of users)

React is just the view layer. We can go over to the [react docs](https://reactjs.org/) - Which are some of the best docs out there.

Let's look at a few screenshots from their docs

### History of React

React was created at Facebook. It was used at first for just one specific project. Then it was expanded to more projects, then it began being used at Instagram and then it was made open-source.

This organic growth of React demonstrated that React was a solution that appealed to many developers. React's meteoric rise and continued demand continued appeal makes it worthwhile to learn.

### What is React in terms of code?

React is written in JavaScript. However, it has always relied on the bleeding edge of JavaScript and uses JSX (an HTML-JavaScript hybrid). Therefore, in order for browsers to understand it, it has to be compiled into older JavaScript.

Luckily there is a great technology called [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), that will handle this for us. This lets us write modern React/JavaScript without having to worry whether an older browser is up to date with its JavaScript.

Let's start with a `Hello World` example.

We'll start with some HTML boiler plate
- `mkdir intro_to_react`
- `cd intro_to_react`
- `touch index.html app.js`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <!-- Let's get our Hello World Message to show up here -->
    </div>
    <script src="./app.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

If we were to use vanilla JS to render: our `Hello World` message we'd write something like this:

```js
const message = 'Hello World'

const div = document.querySelector('.container')
div.innerHTML = `<h1>${message}</h1>`
```

Looking at this code, we're probably getting flashbacks to Unit 1 and our first project. Doing simple things was fine, but as our apps got more complex, it was hard to figure out what was going on and where the DOM was being manipulated.

Let's add React and rewrite our `Hello World` using React

We'll need to add 3 libraries

**Important**: Be sure to load these **BEFORE** your `app.js` file and be sure to load them in this order as each one depends on the previous one

1. React - the  main library
2. ReactDOM - specific for the DOM. There are other React libraries. In order to speed up load times, the libraries have been split up
3. Babel - And, we need to convert our React code to something the browser understands
4. Finally, we have to let Babel know to convert our code. to do this we have to add a `type` attribute set to `text/babel`to our `script` tag for our `app.js`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <!-- Let's get our Hello World Message to show up here -->
    </div>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.3.2/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.3.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.26.0/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel" src="./app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
 Let's write some React:

 Our message will be the same but we won't use our vanilla JS anymore

 We have to call a function from ReactDOM called `render`, that will take two arguments. The first will be what JSX we'll want to render, and the second is a vanilla js querySelector to point our app to where the code should load:

 ```js
 const message = 'Hello World'

// const div = document.querySelector('.container')
// div.innerHTML = '<h1>' + message + '</h1>'

 ReactDOM.render(
    <h1>{message}</h1>,
    document.querySelector('.container')
 );
 ```

Now, when we reload the page we should see some messages in our dev tools

![dev tool messages](https://i.imgur.com/ZGYb2LM.png)

It is optional, but can be handy to have the React Dev Tools, we won't need them right now, but fee free to grab them at any time. [Go to Chrome Plug ins](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

The yellow message is a warning. Remember there can several environments for projects, the two main ones are `development` (what we mostly do for lessons labs and hw) and `production` (when we host our work on heroku). For development we may use testing tools, and we may also use un-minified code so we can look through it/read error messages, and use other packages that help us debug and build our apps. However, in production, we want the code to be served quickly, so we don't want to load anything we use for debugging or testing and we want to provide minified code that is a smaller file. So this message is a friendly reminder that there is a more optimal way to provide your scripts for a web application that is in production.

Finally, we get an error message about not having access to our file.

In short, it's not safe to request files the way we are asking for them. We could set our Chrome settings to allow it. But a better choice would be to run a simple server.

We could build a tiny express server every time we want to write some React. But, that can get tedious.

A mac computer already has a simple server installed (written in python)

#### Run a simple server:

**Important**  start this server from the same level as the `index.html` you want to render


- If you have python 2.x
  - `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

- If you have python 3.x
  - `python -m http.server [<portNo>]`
  <br>
    ex:`python -m http.server 8080`

- If you want to use npm ( or are on Windows/ don't have python installed)
    - Install, if you haven't already, with `npm install -g http-server` (might need to run `sudo npm install -g http-server`)
    - run `http-server -o`

#### Important Note
- To see updates you must refresh your browser, all three of the servers above do cache things, so you may have to do a hard refresh (hold shift key when doing a refresh) to see your changes. Remember `command shift r` as the hot keys


OK! We should be seeing our React Hellow World app!

![hello world app](https://i.imgur.com/AdtEkEx.png)

We may still be getting a 404 favicon error like this one

![favicon error](https://i.imgur.com/avkVvRW.png)

A favicon is the little icon that appears on web browser tabs. We don't have one for our app. It's ok. We just have to learn to dismiss this error. Later, when you build your project you can add a custom favicon.


#### Conclusion

When we compare our vanilla js code to our react code, at this point, all there is, is a slightly different syntax and a little more set up.

Let's compare one more time

```js
// the 'data' we want to render:
const message = 'Hello World'

// Using vanilla JS:
const div = document.querySelector('.container')
div.innerHTML = `<h1>${message}</h1>`

// Using React:
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>{message}</h1>,
  document.querySelector('.container')
)

```

Two things that may stand out:

1. The React syntax is much easier to read than the vanilla js
2. React took a lot more set up to get going over vanilla js. As you learn React, you'll learn more and more tools to help make developing React apps easier and better. But for now, we'll keep it simple
