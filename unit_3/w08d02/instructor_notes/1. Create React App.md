# Intro to Create React App

## Learning Objectives

 - Learn about Create React App
 - Review All the React we learned yesterday by rebuilding our app in Create React App
 - Learn what some of the pros and cons of Create React App are
 - Learn how to build an app with Create React App


## It's 2019 Y'all

If you've googled anything about what to learn to be a web developer, you've likely been overwhelmingly crushed by the number of tools, technologies and buckets full of acronym soup.

All of these tools are meant to solve problems. But with too many tools it can be a problem in and of itself. Which one(s) do you learn? Additionally, as new web devs a lot of the tools can seem like total magic and it can be really hard to to figure out what is what and it can even impede learning when you take on too much too fast. Especially when the documentation is not very good.

So we've been really selective about which tools we teach. Thinking about what be will serve you post-course.

**Create React App** is built buy facebook and it is meant for:
- Learning React in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment (good errors! warnings, notes about best practices, hot reloading, zero configuration)
- Starting new single page applications
- Creating Examples with react for  your libraries and components

[More info](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app)

Create React App isn't the best choice for:
- a sandbox where you just want to try some samples out (try a simple html page like we did yesterday or a react sandbox - linked above)
- A mostly static site (portfolio, blog) - try Gatsby!
- Server side rendering (yes! With a front-end framework! What is next? Cats and dogs being friends?!) - look into Next.js

Takeaway - soon you'll be on your own and you'll be trying to learn new things and get ready for job interviews. How do you figure out what to learn?
- figure out what you want to build and THEN figure out the right tools
- Start small and then add what you need
- Look at the job market and learn something that seems to be popular in the area


## Let's get started

Let's build a playlist maker. Something like so:

![](https://i.imgur.com/ONJG49q.png)

[Create React Docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

- `create-react-app tunr_app`
- `cd tunr_app`
- `rm -rf .git` - because we are in the class repository - no git reps inside other git repos!
- open a new tab in terminal
- `npm start`
- in the other open tab `atom .`

![](https://i.imgur.com/AlBJBso.png)


Let's look at our folders

![](https://i.imgur.com/ovMXd4n.png)

The `public` folder holds static assets like the favicon and the `index.html` that will load in the browser

The `src` folder has a lot new things

- `App.css` - a different way to organize and use CSS than what we are used to. [As a bonus you can learn this way](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-stylesheet) or we can just link our CSS like we always have been or you can work in the `index.css` file

- `App.js` the main React component, we'll be writing in here
- `App.test.js` - we haven't gotten a chance to dive into testing but if you look at the code, in summary it says if the app doesn't crash load it. If the app does crash a lot of things happen but they require some deeper poking aorund
- `index.css` - if you do your css in here, it will be most familiar to what we've already been doing in the course.
- `index.js` - this file has some magic going in in it. Suffice to say, if you create React components in the `src` folder, they will magically work
- `logo.svg`-that's that spinning react logo you see in the browser. SVG is a really great technology worth exploring sometime later...
- `serviceWorker.js`, rather than an express app serving our web pages, this service worker is helping us interact with our app in the browser. [More info](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) - we are going to go ahead and call this part 'magic' since we don't have time to jump down this rabit hole.

Note: if you need to add a dependency you'd just run `npm install react-router-dom` or any other dependency you might want.

## Let's Get Coding
- Open the `src` folder
- open the `App.js` file
- remove the text inside the `p` tag and put some of your own words

![](https://i.imgur.com/SSM71Qt.png)
- save the file
- look at the browser

Notice! you didn't have to reload the browser! ðŸŽ‰


## Make This App Our Own

Let's rebuild our app from yesterday and then build on top of it.

Let's remove all the create react app showcase stuff

![](https://i.imgur.com/KTvcaIx.png)

Our component, now should look familiar to yesterday.
However, what is new is the `import` `export` portions.

For every component we'll need to import `React` and export at least one thing.

Our `App` component is our top level component that will be our main entry into our app and contain our main components.

- Inside the `div` let's add back and `h1` inside a header

```html
<header>
  <h1>Tunr</h1>
</header>
```
We added a click event that allowed us to click on the h1 and change the h2 below it

We must set up our constructor in order to add state.


## Add some 'data'
- `touch src/data.js`
- copy paste the following

```js
const playlists =
  {
    title: 'Playlist 1',
    created: Date.now(),
    songs: [
      {
        artist: 'Talking Heads',
        title: 'Once in a Lifetime',
        time: '3:37',
      },
      {
        artist: 'The Clash',
        title: 'Lost in the Supermarket',
        time: '3:44',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Peter Gabriel',
        title: 'Shaking the Tree',
        time: '7:24',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Slowdive',
        title: 'Don\'t Know Why',
        time: '4:42',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Joanna Serrat',
        title: 'Keep on Fallin\'',
        time: '4:47',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Tullycraft',
        title: 'Hearts at the Sound',
        time: '3:44',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Dead Sara',
        title: 'Something Good',
        time: '4:39',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Chaka Khan',
        title: 'Like Sugar',
        time: '4:01',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Alvvays',
        title: 'Lollipop (Ode to Jim)',
        time: '4:39',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Mazzy Star',
        title: 'Flowers in December',
        time: '4:23',
      }
    ]
  }

export default playlists

```
- add `export default playlists` at the bottom of this file

- in `App.js` add

```js
import playlists from './data.js'
console.log(playlists)
```


Create a constructor and Add to State
```js
this.state = {
  playlists: playlists
}
```
check your browser's dev tools console to see the 'data'

Looking at our mockup we probably want a div that will hold all of our playlists.

Right now, we have one playlist. For each playlist let's have a div. Let's give them both classes.

And let's build out a table for our playlists

```js
<div className="App">
  <div className="playlist">\
    <h3>{this.state.playlists.title}</h3>
    <table>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>Artist</th>
         <th>Title</th>
         <th>Time</th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>{this.state.playlists.songs[0].artist}</td>
         <td>{this.state.playlists.songs[0].title}</td>
         <td>{this.state.playlists.songs[0].time}</td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
  </div>
</div>
```

Let's loop through our playlist and add rows for each song

```js
<tbody>
  {this.state.playlists.songs.map(songs => {
    return (
      <tr>
        <td>{song.artist}</td>
        <td>{song.title}</td>
        <td>{song.time}</td>
      </tr>
    )
  })}
</tbody>
```

Uh-oh we get an error:

![](https://i.imgur.com/RjCFPbe.png)

Create React App is going to keep giving us errors and warnings to be sure we're following best practices. Let's do what it says and add a unique key. Since this is fake data from an array we can just use the array index position for now. This isn't a foolproof way to add a unique key because index positions can change. But once we start using real data we can use the `id`

Let's fix the error

```js
<tbody>
  {this.state.playlists.songs.map((song, index) => {
    return (
      <tr key={index}>
        <td>{song.title}</td>
        <td>{song.artist}</td>
        <td>{song.time}</td>
      </tr>
    )
  })}
</tbody>
```


## Set Up Inputs in a Form

Between our `header` and first `div`

```html
<form>
  <label htmlFor='title'>title</label>
  <input type='text' value={this.state.title} id='title'/>
</form>
```

Let's handle the input

- add `title:''` to state
- add `this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)` to the constructor

```js
handleChange (event) {
  this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value })
}
```

Add the event listener

```js
    <input type='text' value={this.state.name} onChange={this.handleChange} id='name' />
```

Add the rest of the fields to state

```js
this.state = {
  playlists: playlists,
  title: '',
  artist: 0,
  time: '0:00',
}
```
## Make a a Preview

We don't need this, but it may help us visualize our state as we continue to build for now

```js
<div>
  <h2>Preview our new song</h2>
  <h3>{this.state.title}</h3>
  <h4>{this.state.artist}</h4>
  <h5>{this.state.time}</h5>
</div>
```


Let's build out the rest of the form:

```html
<form>
  <label htmlFor='artist'>artist</label>
  <input type='text' value={this.state.artist} id='artist' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
  <label htmlFor='title'>title</label>
  <input type='text' value={this.state.title} id='title' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
  <label htmlFor='time'>time</label>
  <input type='text' value={this.state.time} id='time' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
  <input type='submit' />
</form>
```

Add our soon-to-exist submit function
```html
<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
```


Write our submit function (and don't forget to bind it in the constructor)

Because we have a nested array inside our object (songs), we are going to have to get a little fancy with some newer JS.

We should not ever mutate state directly. We must update state with `this.setState()`

First, we're going to create a new object with our state we collected from our inputs.

Then we are going to make a new array, using the destructuring spread operator so that we don't alter state outside of `setState`.

Finally, inside of setState, we'll update our songs array to our new array

```js
handleSubmit(event){
  event.preventDefault()
  const newSong = {
    title: this.state.title,
    artist: this.state.artist,
    time: this.state.time
  }

  const updatedSongs = [ ...this.state.playlists.songs, newSong ]

  this.setState({
    playlists: {
      songs: updatedSongs
    },
    name: '',
    artist: '',
    time: '0:00'
  })
}
```

Oh no! If you notice the `Playlist 1` that was at the top of our site has gone away. Can you figure out why?

Our playlist state consists of an object with a `songs`, `created` and `title` key. But when we add another song, we tell our React app to set the playlists state to only a `songs` key with a value of the updated songs. What we need to do is to tell our app to keep all of the information that was in our playlists object the same and only update the `songs` key. We can do that with the spread operator!

```js
handleSubmit(event){
  event.preventDefault()
  const newSong = {
    title: this.state.title,
    artist: this.state.artist,
    time: this.state.time
  }

  const updatedSongs = [ ...this.state.playlists.songs, newSong ]
  
  this.setState({
    playlists: {
      ...playlists,
      songs: updatedSongs
    },
    name: '',
    artist: '',
    time: '0:00'
  })
}
```

Now if we try our app our new song should be added but with the rest of our playlist state left intact

Your final `App.js` should look something like this:

```JSX

import './App.css';

import React, { Component } from 'react';

import playlists from './data'

class App extends Component {

  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = {
      playlists: playlists,
      title: '',
      artist: '',
      time: '0:00',
    }

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this)
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    console.log(event.target.value)
    this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value })
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const newSong = {
      title: this.state.title,
      artist: this.state.artist,
      time: this.state.time,
    }

    const updatedSongs = [ ...this.state.playlists.songs, newSong ]
    
    this.setState({
      playlists: {
        ...playlists,
        songs: updatedSongs
      },
      title: '',
      artist: '',
      time: '0:00',
    })
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h3>{this.state.playlists.title}</h3>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <label htmlFor='artist'>artist</label>
          <input type='text' value={this.state.artist} id='artist' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
          <label htmlFor='title'>title</label>
          <input type='text' value={this.state.title} id='title' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
          <label htmlFor='time'>time</label>
          <input type='text' value={this.state.time} id='time' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
          <input type='submit' />
        </form>
        <div className="playlist">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Artist</th>
                <th>Title</th>
                <th>Time</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              {
                this.state.playlists.songs.map((song, index) => {
                  return(
                    <tr key={index}>
                      <td>{song.artist}</td>
                      <td>{song.title}</td>
                      <td>{song.time}</td>
                    </tr>
                  )
                })
              }
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;


```
<!-- 
## Add a New Component

- make sure you are on the same level as `package.json`
- `mkdir src/components`
- `touch src/components/SongList.js`

**src/components/SongList.js**
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class SongList extends Component {
  render () {
    return (<h3> All the Songs</h3>)
  }
}

export default SongList;
```

## Import and render it in our `App.js`

```js
import SongList from './components/SongList.js'
```
Add it below our div with a className of playlists

```js
<div className="playlists">
  <SongList />
``` -->
