# Set up

Use Create React App (and don't forget to remove the .git)

**OR**

1. `mkdir heirloom-app`
1. `cd heirloom-app`
1. `touch app.js index.html`
1. `atom .`
1. `index.html`
  1. html boilerplate
  1. react cdn links
  1. add `main` tag to body
  1. link `app.js`
1. `app.js`
  1. `RectDom.render()` an `h1` element (e.g. `        <h1> Heirloom Furniture Restoration </h1>`) and have it render inside the `main` tag in the html
1. start a server (`python SimpleHTTPServer`, or `python http.server` or npm `http-server`)


If you are using CREATE REACT APP, clear out all their stuff and just have an h1 element:

You should now have an h1 element render in the DOM

- **Optional** : Bored of plain html? Feel like you need some css practice? Set a timer for 10 minutes and add a `index.css` file, include a google font, background color and font color. If you have some leftover time try to style some thing else, a special style for the h1? You'll be using a `ul` and `li`s as well, maybe some other colors or fonts there?

## Inside the App class



```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div className='container'>
        <h1 className='shop-name'>Heirloom Furniture Restoration</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

## Add State to the App Component

[State should be set in the constructor](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

```js
constructor (props) {
  super(props)
  this.state = {chair: "Grandma's Favorite Chair"}
}
```

## Create a Furniture Component and Pass Props

1. Create a `Furniture` class
1. have the render function return a `ul` with one `li`
element inside of it. This `li` element should render {this.props.chair} as `Grandma's Favorite Chair`

## Write a Function that is Called by a Click Event

1. inside the App class

```js

restore () {
  console.log('clicked it and the value of this is:', this)
}
```
1. Add a click event to the `li` in the Furniture component
1. Not working? Make sure you pass it from App to Furniture
1. `this` is undefined/null? Make sure you add the function to the constructor and bind `this`

Once the function is called on and this has the expected value:
1. Let's give that `restore` function some more functionality. This app is going to help people figure out how best to restore their heirloom pieces
1. Obviously, in 2018, the best way to restore furniture is to paint it white. Let's add the code to do that

```js
restore () {
  this.setState({
    chair: `Paint ${this.state.chair} white`
  })
}
```

On click of the `li` it should now update to read
![white](https://i.imgur.com/sDBr6Bh.png)

1. It isn't obvious that we have to click the li element to get the recommendation:
in the furniture component, inside the li, let's add a button that says Recommendation, and let's move the click event to the button

1. Nice but we can click the button many times, which makes the advice come out a bit, weird

![weird](https://i.imgur.com/Ica0RDg.png)


1. let's fix this by only allowing the button to show up if `recommendationMade` is false
1. Let's update our state to have a key `recommendationMade` with a property of false to start
1. add a ternary operator to determine whether or not a button should be displayed in the Furniture component
1. use the react dev tools to toggle true false
![react dev tools toggle true false](https://i.imgur.com/eFdOzK9.png)
1. not working? did you pass this property down from App?

## Add More Items To restore

Expand state to:
```js
this.state = {
  furniture: [
    {
      piece: "Grandma's Favorite Chair",
      recommendationMade: false,
      id: 1
    },
    {
      piece: 'Grand Armoire',
      recommendationMade: false,
      id: 2
    },
    {
      piece: 'Fainting Couch',
      recommendationMade: false,
      id: 3
    },
    {
      piece: 'Faberg√© Egg',
      recommendationMade: false,
      id: 4
    }
  ]
}
```

1. Make a new class component `ListItem`
1. refactor your code so that you are able to generate all the list items based on the data. The data should just render the data for `piece` right now
1. don't forget to assign `key` to the map elements. You can use `index` or you can also consider using `id` from the data. Since most of the time you'll be getting data from a database and that data will have an id, it is a nice option to fave

Once you are rendering the list without errors it is time to think about restoring the functionality we had

1. Return the recommendation button
1. Add a `console.log` to the `restore` function and console log `this`
1. remember to pass the prop from Furniture to List Item
1. Get the click function to console.log

1. then try to get the right `recommendationMade` to toggle - this will be a multi-step process:

1. We probably want to pass the value of the item. We can't pass it through `this.props.restore` because we can't add an argument this way. But we can define an anonymous function and call our desired function with our arguments that way.
[Handling Events in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

1. don't forget to add a parameter to the restore function

So what we want right now is to click the button and see the item

<details><summary>Hints and Major Spoilers: ListItem Class</summary>


```

class ListItem extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <li>
        {this.props.item.piece}
        {this.props.item.recommendationMade}
        {this.props.item.recommendationMade ? '' : <button onClick={item => this.props.restore(this.props.item)}>Recommendation</button> }
      </li>
    )
  }
}

```

</details>

1. It should be quite easy to update the item...something like:
```
item.recommendationMade = !item.recommendationMade
```

1. We have to call` this.setState({})` at the end of our `restore` function to update our state and thus update our data and view

## Add More Furniture Through a Form

1. Should we make a new component just for a single input form? Nah, having one massive and complex component isn't the react way, but over-normalizing and making every html element a component isn't useful either
1. In our App component let's set up a form - two inputs, one text, one submit, right below the `h1`
1. write two functions, one for handling the item input change and another for the item input submit
1. add a new property to `this.state` in the app component called `newItem` and set it to an empty string
1. the text input will have an onChange event listener that will call the corresponding function
1. the form will have an on submit that will call the corresponding function, remember to prevent the default behavior for submit, see if you can empty the input after submit as well
1. on submit be sure to create an object that matches our other data and try shifting it into our furniture array
