## MERN Stack Create



Let's add a which we'll make as a separate component

add `NewForm.js` into the components folder

**NewForm.js**
```js
import React from 'react'

class NewForm extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (

    )
  }
}

export default NewForm
```

Add constructor to store state

```js
class NewForm extends React.Component {
  constructor (props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      name: ''
    }
  }
```

```js
<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
  <label htmlFor="name"></label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" onChange={this.handleChange} value={this.state.name} placeholder="add a holiday"/>
  <input type="submit" value="Add a Reason to Celebrate"/>
</form>
```

**App.js**
```js
import NewForm from './components/NewForm.js'
// further down
return (
  <div className='container'>
   <h1>Holidays! Celebrate!</h1>
   <NewForm />
   <table>
```

Let's build out our `handleSubmit` and `handleChange` functions

First let's bind them in the constructor

```js
this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this)
```

Now let's build our functionality

```js
handleChange (event) {
  this.setState({ [event.currentTarget.id]: event.currentTarget.value})
}
```

To submit, we have to prevent the default behavior of the form.

We also have to send this data back up to our app component so it can be passed down to the list.

**App.js**
```js
// constructor
   this.handleAddHoliday = this.handleAddHoliday.bind(this)
// further down
handleAddHoliday(holiday) {
  const copyHolidays = [...this.state.holidays]
  copyHolidays.unshift(holiday)
  this.setState({
    holidays: copyHolidays,
    name: ''
  })
}
// further down (in render)
<NewForm handleAddHoliday={this.handleAddHoliday}/>

```

We then have to make a fetch request. When we are just making a get request, we just use one argument, a string, where we are making our request. However, for any other action, we have to add a second argument, an object.

We'll have to add a method, a body (the data from our form), and some headers.


**THEN** when we get a response we need to convert it to json. This is an extra step we didn't have to take when we used `$.ajax`. Fetch is ultra-lightweight so we have to write a bit more code. You could use jQuery, axious, ky or other libraries, but our app is simple so let's just use fetch.

**THEN**
we want to take that json-ed response and add our new holiday to our list


```js
handleSubmit (event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  fetch(baseURL + '/holidays', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({name: this.state.name}),
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }).then (res => res.json())
    .then (resJson => {
      this.props.handleAddHoliday(resJson)
      this.setState({
        name: ''
      })
  }).catch (error => console.error({'Error': error}))
}
```
