![](https://phz8.petinsurance.com/-/media/all-phz-images/2016-images-850/dogandcatonbed850.jpg)

The Sunny Philadelphia Animal Shelter has been looking for volunteers to set up their website, so you offered your help because what better way to add onto your resume and use your newly acquired knowledge for web development? Let's get started, there are animals that need to be adopted!

#### Learning Objectives

- Full CRUD app express API with React frontend

#### Prerequisites

- JavaScript
- Node / Express
- React fundamentals

---

## Getting Started

1. In today's `student_labs` folder, `mkdir sunny_shelter` and `cd` into it
1. `mkdir sunny_shelter_api`
1. `cd sunny_shelter_api`
1. `touch server.js`
1. `npm init`
1. Set entry point as `server.js`
1. `npm i express`
1. Set up your express server -- this should be easier now after unit 2, but if you need a refresher look back at the notes!

## Creating the Express API

Set up a full CRUD Express API for the animals that will be listed on the website as up for adoption. Since we have no frontend at this point just yet, test to make sure your routes are working as you go along by using `curl`. NOTE: remember that we're creating an _API_, so our data will be JSON.

### Guide


1. Create an animal model, a sample schema can be found below:
    ```
    {
      name: String,
      species: String,
      breed: String,
      image: {type: String, default: 'https://loremflickr.com/240/120'},
      age: Number,
      adopted: Boolean,
      personalityTraits: [{type: String}]
    }
    ```
1. Make a create route
1. Make an index route
1. Make a delete route
1. Make an update route
1. Again, remember to check all your above routes work by testing it with `curl`

## Consuming the API with React

Now that we have an API, we want to actually connect it to a front-end. So, let's go ahead and create the front-end of the Animal Shelter's website that will use our API data.

### Guide

1. Make sure to `cd` up and out of your express API first
1. Use Create React App
1. don't forget to `rm -rf .git`
1. Recommended that you go in the same order as we are in class
1. Don't forget to configure CORS


> :cat: Afternoon Lab ends here, if you finish early, feel free to try and carry on with [tomorrow's lab](/unit_3/w08d02/student_labs/README.md), or try some of the stretch goals below.

## Stretch Goals
1. Practice HTML/CSS by giving your animal shelter site some sweet styling
1. Figure out how to add `personalityTraits` like 'friendly', 'shy', 'only slightly evil',
