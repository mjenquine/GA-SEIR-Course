## MERN Delete


Let's add a new table cell

**App.js**
```js
<tbody>
  { this.state.holidays.map(holiday => {
      return (
        <tr key={holiday._id} >
          <td> {holiday.name }</td>
          <td>X</td>
        </tr>
      )
    })
  }
</tbody>
```

Let's add a function called delete holiday. It will do two things, make a call to our api to delete the holiday and **then** update our view to reflect our data

```js
deleteHoliday (id) {
  fetch(baseURL + '/holidays/' + id, {
    method: 'DELETE'
  }).then( response => {
    const findIndex = this.state.holidays.findIndex(holiday => holiday._id === id)
    const copyHolidays = [...this.state.holidays]
    copyHolidays.splice(findIndex, 1)
    this.setState({holidays: copyHolidays})
  })
}
```

Bind it in our constructor

```js
   this.deleteHoliday = this.deleteHoliday.bind(this)
```

Now we'll add a click event to our new `td`

**gotcha** in order to pass an argument in our click event we have to wrap our function inside an anonymous function


```js
<td onClick={()=>this.deleteHoliday(holiday._id)}>X</td>
```
