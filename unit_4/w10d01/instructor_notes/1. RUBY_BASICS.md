## What is Ruby?

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/) is a high-level  programming language that gives us a lot of nice features out of the box.

It is meant to be pretty, unobtrusive, and super readable.

Ruby does **not** run in the browser.  It is most commonly used for backend web development with frameworks like [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

## What's Ruby like? 

### M.I.N.A.S.W.A.N.

* "Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice"
* Mentality not only applies to how you should treat your fellow developers, but also the philosophy behind Ruby itself.
* Yukihiro Matsumoto ("Matz") created Ruby to increase developer happiness.

> "Programmers often feel joy when they can concentrate on the creative side of programming, so Ruby is designed to make programmers happy." — Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto  

### A **Natural** Language

While it isn't exactly simple, a lot of its features are going to feel intuitive.  

> "Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body." — Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto  


## Running Ruby

Just run `ruby FILENAME.rb`! 
 <!-- You can also run [`pry`](http://pryrepl.org/) this is a Ruby `repl`.

> [`irb`](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/interactive_ruby.htm) is the official ruby repl but `pry` is much better -->

## Numbers

Numbers in Ruby are in the [`Numeric`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Numeric.html) class.  It's subclasses include [`Integer`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Integer.html) and [`Float`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Float.html)

```ruby
1.class # => Integer
1.0.class # => Float

2 - 3 # => -1
2 * 3 # => 6
1 + 1 # => 2
1 / 2 # => 0 (rounds down)
1 / 2.0 #=> 0.5 (does not round float)
```

## Strings

A [`String`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/String.html) in Ruby is similar to strings in JS.

```ruby
"foo".length # => 3
"foo".include?("o") # => true
```

> In ruby the convention is to use `?` for methods that return booleans . (in JS we use verbs like `is` or `did`)

However, strings are **mutable** (unlike in JS)

```ruby
str = "foo"
str.upcase # => "FOO"

str # => "foo" (upcase does not mutate str)
str.upcase! # => "FOO"
str # => "FOO" (upcase! DOES mutate str)
```

By default, strings are immutable, the same as in Javascript. But methods can be made immutable by having `!` at the end of a method. Remember, mutating data can be **dangerous** as it can lead to unintended side-effects. Think carefully before using a mutation method.

### Interpolation

To interpolate strings in Ruby, you must use double quotes

```ruby
"I have #{13 * 4} cards" # => "I have 52 cards"
'I have #{13 * 4} cards' # => 'I have #{13 * 4} cards'
```

> In case you forgot, ES6 string interpolation ```looks like `${this}` ```

### Concatenation

You can also concatenate strings but this is NOT recommend

```ruby
"foo" + "bar" # => "foobar"
"foo" + 2 # => TypeError: no implicit conversion of Integer into String
"foo" + 2.to_s # => "foo2"
```

Above we see that we can NOT implicitly convert a non-string into a string (unlike what we have seen in JS).


Use single quotes for strings that are not interpolated

<!-- > Warning: Backticks are *not* used for strings! They are used to execute commands. -->


## Symbols

A [Symbol](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Symbol.html) is similar to a `String`.  It cannot be mutated or manipulated.  It is used represent _things_ rather than _text_.  Symbols start with `:`.

```ruby
:foo # => :foo
:foo == :foo # => true
:foo == :bar # => false
:foo == "foo" # false
```

The more you see them the more you will understand the use-case.
Symbols use memory more efficiently
```ruby
string1 = "hello"
string2 = "hello"
symbol1 = :hello
symbol2 = :hello

string1.object_id #=> 1234
string2.object_id #=> 4567

symbol1.object_id #=> 7890
symbol2.object_id #=> 7890
```
  

## Booleans and `nil`

Of course Ruby has two booleans `true` and `false`

Each object has a `==` method that compares to another object.

```ruby
1 == 1 # => true
1 == "1" # => false
1 == 1.0 # => true
[:foo, :bar] == [:foo, :bar] # => true
[:foo, :bar] == [:bar, :foo] # => false
{a: 1, b: 2} == {b: 2, a: 1} # => true
```

> Do NOT use `===`. This is not the same as what it means in JS.  (Look it up if you are curious)

Ruby also has `nil`.  This is similar to `null` or `undefined` in JS. (There is no distinction in Ruby)

### Truthy and Falsy

Ruby only has **two** falsy values: `nil` and `false`.

So unlike JS `0` and `""` are truthy.  (There is no `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `-0`)

```ruby
!! false # => false
!! nil # => false

!! 0 # => true
!! "" # => true
```

## Arrays

A Ruby [`Array`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Array.html) is similar to a JS Array.

```ruby
arr = [:Gustave, :Sandrine, :Delphine, :Maurice]
arr.length # => 4

arr.first # => :Gustave
arr.last # => :Maurice
arr[1] # => :Sandrine
arr[100] # => nil

arr.include?(:Sandrine) # => true

arr.push(:Clementine) # => [:Gustave, :Sandrine, :Delphine, :Maurice, :Clementine]
arr               # => [:Gustave, :Sandrine, :Delphine, :Maurice, :Clementine]
```

To get the last few elements we can use negative indexes

```ruby
arr[-1] # => :Clementine
arr[-2] # => :Maurice
```

We can also concatenate arrays

```ruby
[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5] # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# (this is a new array. neither is mutated)
```
## Range
A [`Range`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Range.html) allows you to define a range of values. You can then turn that range into an array and get all the sweet array methods. This is a great technique to avoid for loops. you can use three dots instead of two for an exclusive range.
```ruby
(1..10).to_a #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
(1...10).to_a #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
``` 
## Hashes

A [`Hash`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Hash.html) is similar to a JS object.

```ruby
gustave = { 'name' => 'Gustave', 'age' => 2.5 }
gustave['name'] # => 'Gustave'
gustave['foo'] # => nil
```

We use ONLY bracket notation to get and set values

```ruby
gustave['age'] # => 2.5
gustave.age # => NoMethodError: undefined method `age' for Hash

gustave['age'] = 10
gustave['age'] # => 10

gustave.age = 25 # => NoMethodError: undefined method `age=' for Hash
```

By convention, `Hash` keys are usually `Symbol`s not `String`s

```ruby
gustave = { :name => 'Gustave', :age => 24 }
gustave[:name] # => 'Gustave'
gustave['name'] # => nil
```

Since using symbols as keys is so common, there is a nice short-hand

This is exactly the same as what we saw above.

```ruby
gustave = { name: 'Gustave', age: 24 }
```

Notice that is looks exactly like a JS object except the keys are symbols, not strings.


## Iteration

In JS if we wanted to print numbers 0 through 3 we would:

```javascript
for(var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// > 0
// > 1
// > 2
```

In Ruby this is much cleaner:

```ruby
3.times { |i| puts i }
# > 0
# > 1
# > 2
```

`times` is a method that takes a _block_.  A block is just a chunk of code that may or may not take arguments.  The closest thing to a block in ES6-land would be an (anonymous) arrow function.

<!-- > Yes there _are_ `for` loops in Ruby but we DO NOT use them -->

We can also iterate over arrays:

```ruby
arr = [10, 20, 30]

arr.each { |num| puts num }
# > 10
# > 20
# > 30

arr.map { |num| num / 10 }
# => [1, 2, 3]
```

For comparison sake, let's show the above in Javascript

```js
const arr = [10,20,30]

arr.forEach(num => console.log(num))
// 10
// 20
// 30

arr.map(num => num / 10)
// [1,2,3]
```

`each` and `map` also take blocks (just like `forEach` and `map` take callbacks in JS).

For blocks with longer lines or multiple lines, replace `{` and `}` with `do` and `end`

```ruby
arr.map do |num|
  "#{num / 10} is great!"
end
# => ["1 is great!", "2 is great!", "3 is great!"]
```

And we can iterate over hashes:

```ruby
hash = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
hash.each do |key, val|
  puts "the value of #{key} is #{val}"
end
# > the value of a is 1
# > the value of b is 2
# > the value of c is 3
```

## Methods

In Ruby everything is a [`Method`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Method.html).  There are NO functions!


```ruby
def add(a, b)
  a + b
end

add(1, 2) # => 3

add(1, 2, 3)
# > ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 3, expected 2)
```

Notice we do not need the keyword `return`.  The last line hit by the method will always be the return value.  This is called an _implicit return_.

We can add default arguments

```ruby
def add(a, b=10)
  a + b
end

add(1, 2) # => 3
add(1) # => 11 (b defaults to 10)
```

We can also have an arbitrary number of arguments

```ruby
def add(*nums)
  return 0 if nums.empty?
  nums.reduce { |sum, n| sum + n }
end
```

Above, the `nums` object is just an array of the arguments given.  If there are no arguments given, the `nums` will be empty and we will `return` early.

We also do NOT use parentheses when calling a method without arguments

```ruby
def say_hi(name = 'World')
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

say_hi('Gustave')
# > Hello, Gustave!
say_hi
# > Hello, World!
```

We called the method without using parens!

### Bonus: [defining methods that `yield` blocks](blocks.md)



## Control Flow

Ruby and JS (and many languages) have similar control flow patterns.

### `if`/`elsif`/`else` and ternary


```ruby
def number_message(num)
  if num < 10
    puts 'what a small number'
  elsif num > 10
    puts 'That is a big number!'
  else
    puts 'That number is just right!'
  end
end
```

#### `if` / `unless`
We also have single-line ifs

```ruby
puts 'you are old!' if age >= 100
```

You may even see `unless`

```ruby
puts 'you are old!' unless age < 100
```
When you see an `unless foo`, read it as `if !foo`

> `if !foo` can always be written as `unless foo` which creates a more readable line


#### Ternary operator  

A ternary operator looks just like we have seen in JS

```ruby
num.even? ? "#{num} is even!" : "#{num} is odd!"
```

### `while` loops

```ruby
a = 10
while a.positive?
  puts a
  a -= 1
end
```

> There are also `until` loops. While is to `until` as `if` is to `unless`

### Binary operators `&&`/`||`

Binary operators are pretty much the same as in JS :)

```ruby
1 && 2 # => 2 (truthy)
nil && 2 # => nil (falsy)
1 && nil # => nil (falsy)

1 || nil # => 1 (truthy)
nil || 2 # => 2 (truthy)
false || nil # => nil (falsy)
```

## Error-handling

In Ruby we have `raise` to throw errors and `rescue` to catch them.

These are most common when using and creating external APIs but probably don't need to be used in your own internal code.

If you are interested flex your google muscles and learn it on your own ;)

## Constants

Constants in Ruby always start with a capital letter.  Every `Class` is constant (Like `String` and `Numeric`).  Constants cannot be reassigned.

> Do not treat constants like ES6's `const`.  Do not create constant variables inside of methods.  Use them only for classes/modules and for [class constants](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/constants.html)

## Style Things

The Ruby community is very opinionated about styling.  As you are starting out, you MUST follow [these rules](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

Here are the most important rules

**Casing**

* All variables and methods must use `snake_case`
* All classes and modules must use `CamelCase`
* All constants (besides classes and modules) must use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

**Blocks**

* A single line block must use `{` and `}`
* A multi-line must use `do` and `end`
* If an argument is unused it should start with `_` (or just be named `_`)
  * `hash.each { |_key, val| puts val }`

**Methods**

* A method should end with a `?` if an only if it always returns a boolean
  * These are called _predicate methods_
* A method ending in `!` should be a _dangerous_ version of the method sans `!`
  * _dangerous_ means either that it can mutate the object _or_ that can raise an error
* Don't name methods like `get_foo`, `set_foo`. They should be `foo` and `foo=`
* **Do** use `attr_reader` and `attr_writer`
* Do not use parens when calling a method without args
  * `super` is one possible exception
* **Do** use parens for every method except for DSLs (and a small list of other common methods)
  * `attr_reader`, `puts`, `require`, `include`, `it`, `has_many`, ...

**Other stuff**

* Do not use `for`/`in` loops
* Do not use _class variables_ (`@@these_things`)
* Always use two spaces to indent
  * Your text editor should do this for you when you hit tab
* Don't use semi-colons (unless you are aware of the few exceptions)
* Do not use global variables (`$these_things`). Usually a constant will do


## Note about Sigils

JS does not have Sigils.  In ruby, starting a variable with a sigil (`@`, `@@`, `$`, `:`, or a capital letter) affects the compiler.

Instance variable | Class variable | Global variable | Symbol | Constant
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
`@foo` | `@@foo` | `$foo` | `:foo` | `Foo`
_ivars_. (next lecture) | Research if interested | Research if interested | [Discussed above](#symbols) | [Discussed above](#constants)
