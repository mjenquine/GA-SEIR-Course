# Ruby - Blocks

## Lesson Objectives

1. Compare JS forEach with Ruby each
1. Compare JS map with Ruby map
1. Create custom functions that use blocks
1. Describe and use a proc

## Compare JS forEach with Ruby each

Here's our JS forEach

```javascript
const myArray = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
myArray.forEach((str)=>{
	console.log('the value is ' + str);
});
```

Here's the ruby version of the same code.

```ruby
['one', 'two', 'three'].each do |str|
	puts 'the value is ' + str
end
```

All code from `do` to `end` is called a ruby "block", since it's a block of code that the call function executes.  It's just like the anonymous functions of JavaScript.

There's even a version of the code that takes only one line

```ruby
['one', 'two', 'three'].each { |str| puts 'the value is ' + str } #short form
```

## Compare JS map with Ruby map

Here's our JS map

```javascript
const basicArray = [1,2,3];
const timesTwo = basicArray.map((num)=>{
  return num * 2;
});

console.log(timesTwo);
```

Here's the ruby version of the same code

```ruby
times_two = [1,2,3].map do |num|
	num * 2
end

p times_two
```

Here's the version that takes only one line

```ruby
p [1,2,3].map {|num| num * 2}
```

## Creating your own blocks

You can create functions that execute blocks.

let's create our own "each" function.  Here's the JS version:

```javascript
const each = (array, callback)=>{
	for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
		callback(array[i]);
	}
}

each([1,2,3,4], (currentNum)=>{
	console.log(currentNum);
});
```

```ruby
def each(arr, &blk) #&blk must always be the last parameter
	for elem in arr
		blk.call(elem)
	end
end

each 0...5 do |currentNum|
	puts currentNum
end
```

- The `&blk` is just a variable that comes in
- The `&` means pass by reference
	- This means that the variable `&blk` points to something and is not a copy of whatever was passed in
- Therefore &blk is just a reference to the block of code between `do` and `end`
- We can execute that code by calling blk.call()

If we don't want to bother with &blk, we have a shortcut:

```ruby
def each(arr)
	for elem in arr
		yield(elem) #use this instead of &blk.call
	end
end

each 0...5 do |currentNum|
	puts currentNum
end
```

__Yield__ is a Ruby keyword that calls a block when you use it. Itâ€™s how methods USE blocks!

When you use the yield keyword, the code inside the block will run & do its work.

Just like when you call a regular Ruby method.

## Describe and use a proc

A Proc object is an encapsulation of a block of code, which can be stored in a local variable, passed to a method or another Proc, and can be called. 

Proc is an essential concept in Ruby and a core of its functional programming features.

- A block is just a type of variable called a `proc`
- `procs` are just ways to save functions into variables for later use

[More on Proc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Proc.html)

```ruby
log = Proc.new do |el|
	puts el
end
log.call(5)
```

short version:

```ruby
log = Proc.new {|el| puts el}
log.call(5)
```

Making callbacks work in JS

```javascript
const foo = ()=>{
	console.log('hi');
}

const bar = (callback)=>{
	callback();
}
bar(foo)
```

Making callbacks work in ruby 

```ruby
foo = Proc.new do
    puts 'hi'
end

def bar(callback)
    callback.call()
end

bar(foo)
```
