# RAILS RELATIONSHIPS

### More Migrations and Active Record with Relational data

### Lesson Objectives
_After this lesson, students will be able to:_

- Add a second model
- Run more migrations
- Add a foreign key to an existing model
- Seed data
- Query relational data in rails console

<br>
<hr>

### SETUP

* Use the `todo_app_api` project from this morning's lesson

<br>
<hr>


# ONE TO MANY RELATIONSHIP
## has-many and belongs-to

In SQL you saw how to use a foreign key. A foreign key just maps a number to the id of another model. For example, if we have a `User` and a `Todo` model:

User `id: 22`

Todo `user_id: 22`

The user with id 22 will have associated Todos as specified by the Todos' foreign key, `user_id`.

[ActiveRecord Association Basics](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html)

In postgres we could ask for all the Todos that belong to a specific user:

```
SELECT * FROM todos WHERE user_id = 22;
```

In ActiveRecord we could write:

```ruby
User.find(22).todos.all
```

... and get the same result

<!-- 3:05 -->

### What we will do

* We will create a second model, User

* We will make a relationship between todos and users.


> A user will have many todos.

> We do this by giving our Todos a **foreign key** that will reference the User.

> Users and todos will have a **one-to-many relationship**. Users will **have many** todos, and todos will **have one** user, represented by the foreign key.

> Another way to put it is that a User **has many** todos, and a Todo **belongs to** a single User.

## &#x1F449; Run a migration to create a user table

```
rails g migration CreateUsers
```  


- In the migration file, User should have a name (a string)

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
    end
  end
end
```


<!-- ![](https://i.imgur.com/nIOUgiH.png) -->

Run the migration

```
rails db:migrate
```

**Check the user table in schema.rb**

![](https://i.imgur.com/6eglBHI.png)

Yay, we have two tables! Now we just need to relate them.

<br>
<hr>
<!-- 3:13 -->

## &#x1F449; Run a migration to add a foreign key column to the todos tables

* Generate a migration to add a column to the Todo table.

```
rails g migration AddUserIdToTodos
```

<br>

### `add_column` method
Use the `add_column` method. In the *`todos`* table we want to add a column called *`user_id`* which will be an *`integer`*. This integer will be the foreign key. We need to make sure we pass the values to the `add_column` method in that order: table we are modifying, field being added, datatype of field.

```ruby
add_column :todos, :user_id, :integer
```

<!-- ![](https://i.imgur.com/aFqHSYM.png) -->

```
rails db:migrate
```

Check the `schema.rb` file. Todos should have a column called user_id


```ruby
ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 20161223200259) do

  # These are extensions that must be enabled in order to support this database
  enable_extension "plpgsql"

  create_table "todos", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string  "title"
    t.boolean "completed"
    t.integer "user_id"
  end

  create_table "users", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string "name"
  end

end
```

<br>
<hr>

<!-- 3:18 -->

# Models

### User model

* Create a User model

```
app/models/user.rb
```

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord

end
```

We could, if we wanted to, add some entries into the database and query for the related todos in postgres right now, but what we really want is for ActiveRecord to know about this relationship.

* In the User model, specify the model's relation to the Todo model:

```ruby
has_many :todos
```

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :todos
end
```

<!-- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0k8EOmN.png) -->

### Todo model

* In the Todo model, specify the model's relation to the User model:

`belongs_to :user`

```ruby
class Todo < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

<!-- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZlnYXvV.png) -->

The methods `has_many` and `belongs_to` allows active record to read the foreign and primary keys as a relationship between our two Models.

<br>

<!-- 3:25 -->

## Questions?

Now's your turn. I'll give you some time to work until this point. Continue to work on your `todo_app_api` referring to the notes above. Create a user table, add a foreign key to your `todo` table and relate your `User` and `Todo` models together.

# ACTIVE RECORD

### Active Record commands

Open Rails console: `rails c`

1. Create a User. `User.create(name: "Schmitty")`
2. Query for that user and save it to a variable.
  `user = User.find(1)`
3. Create a Todo for that user by accessing `user.todos`

```
user.todos.create(title: "Learn migrations and ActiveRecord", completed: false)
```

Query for `Todo.all` -- notice how the user_id is populated with the id of the user

<!-- 3:28 -->

### Queries for related items

The relationship goes both ways. We can query for the Todo entries that belong to a user, and likewise, query for the User that owns a Todo.

### User -> Todos
See all the todos that **belong to** a specific user:

- `User.find(1).todos.all` or
- `user = User.find(1)` then `user.todos.all`

### Todo -> User
See the user associated with a Todo:

- `Todo.where(user_id: 1)` or
- `Todo.where(user_id: user.id)`

<br>
<hr>

<!-- 3:35 -->


# SEEDING THE DATABASE

Let's give our Users and Todos some seed data.

Open the file `db/seeds.rb`

The pattern for making a single entry is:

```ruby
Model.create({ column: data, column: data })
```

To create a bulk set of User entries using the array syntax:

```ruby
User.create([{ name: "Neff" }, { name: "Jacc" }, { name: "Snoop" }])
```

To create four individual Todo entries:
(note that these have the foreign keys):

```ruby
Todo.create(title: "Accentuate the Positive", completed: false, user_id: 1)

Todo.create(title: "Eliminate the Negative", completed: false, user_id: 1)

Todo.create(title: "Latch on to the Affirmative", completed: false, user_id: 2)

Todo.create(title: "Don't mess with Mister In-Between", completed: false, user_id: 3)
```

**A Todo will not create if the associated user does not yet exist.**

<!-- ![](https://i.imgur.com/JpjyKLM.png) -->


To run the seed file:

```
rails db:seed
```

Check that data was created by opening **rails console** and querying:

```
Todo.all
```

> Query a Todo for its associated User, and query a User for its associated Todos.

# &#x2600; BLOG APP II

Your blog app should be at the point where the database has been created with columns for title, author, and content. Check that this is the case. Open up the blog_app_api directory, `rails dbconsole`, and `SELECT * FROM blogs`.

&#x1F535; **Activity (35 mins)**

* Create a model for the `posts` table that you made this morning (make the `post.rb` file in the `models` directory, and add the Class with inheritance).

* Generate a migration for making a `Users` table
	* User should have a `name` and `password` (strings)

* Run the migration

* Create a model for `User`

* In `user.rb`, make it so the user `has_many` posts.  

* In `post.rb` make it so a post `belongs_to` a user.

Before we make our seed data, we need the post table to have a foreign key column. The foreign key will reference which user the post belongs to.

* Generate a migration for adding a column to the the `Posts` table. The column should be called `user_id` of type integer.

* Run the migration, and check the `schema.rb`

* Seed your data:

In **Rails console:**

* Create two users
* Create a post for each user
* Check that the relations exist

In **seed.rb**

* Create two more users
* Create three posts, all three posts belong to one of the users
* Run the seed
* Check the data in Rails console and in the database

## &#x1F449; UNDOING THINGS

Rails is very strict in terms of the order that you run the command and the naming of what you type. Because of this it is **VERY** common to type the wrong thing and have to go back. If we want to alter our database tables, columns, datatypes, etc. We **do not change them manually** in the schema or in migrations that have already run. Deleting or editing a file will not always work they way you expect. Luckily, Rails gives us some helpful commands to help us when things go south.

<!-- 
Be warned: **THESE ARE NOT A MAGIC PILL**. You still want to very careful when writing your commands so that you don't need to use these. Use these as a last resort. -->


## 1. Adding Columns

**Goal:** Add a column called `description` to our Todo table.

`rails g migration AddDescriptionToTodos`

If you muck up the name of of the migration or something goes wrong, you can remove the migration with

`rails destroy migration <name_of_migration>`


In the migration file, we will use the `add_column` method. The method takes three arguments: the name of the table to alter, the name of the new column, and the datatype for that column:

```ruby
class AddDescriptionToTodos < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    # Method    Table   Column       Datatype
    add_column :todos, :description, :string
  end
end
```

`rails db:migrate`

Check the **schema.rb** file to see that the "description" column was added.

_schema.rb_

![](https://i.imgur.com/Rb7XnUM.png)

<!-- Also, to see your changes, open up rails console `rails c`.

See the columns associated with your table / model with:

```
Model.column_names
```

In this case, `Todo.column_names`

&#x1F535; **Activity**

* Once the migration is complete, create a new Todo with `title`, `description`, and `completed` in rails console.

<br> -->

## 2. Changing columns

Again, if we want to change our schema, we must **run more migrations**. Let's change the name of our `description` column to `details`:

```
rails g migration ChangeDescriptionInTodosToDetails
```

In the migration file, we will use the `rename_column` method that takes three arguments: the name of table to alter, the name of the column to alter, and the new column name:

```ruby
def change
  # Method       Table   Old Column  New Column     
  rename_column :todos, :description, :details
end
```
Then:

```
rails db:migrate
```
<!-- 
* **Check in schema.rb**

Also, open up **Rails console** and check your columns and your data:

```ruby
Todo.column_names
```

```ruby
Todo.all
```

<br> -->

## 3. Removing columns

```
rails g migration RemoveDetailsInTodos
```

In the migration file, we will use the `remove_column` method to remove the column. It takes three arguments: the name of the table to alter, the name of the column to delete, and the datatype of that column:

```ruby
def change
    # Method     Table   Column   Datatype
  remove_column :todos, :details, :string
end
```

Then:

```
rails db:migrate
```
* **Check in schema.rb**

The schema should be back to its original state with just `title` and `completed`.

<!-- You can also open up **Rails console** and check that the column was deleted (No Todo entries should have a `details` column any more).

<br> -->

## 4. Undoing Migration

<!-- Call it `morning_lab_api`

Can you remember the steps involved? Look back over this markdown and make a new project.

The project is a throwaway, but it should have:

* A User model with name and password
* The model should be fully testable in Rails console

**Make any mistakes along the way with migrations?**
Undoing migrations: -->

```
rails db:rollback
```

Rolls back the last migration.

To go all the way back to the beginning, we can use

```
rails db:migrate VERSION=0
```

As you might guess, substituting any other number for 0 migrates to that version number, where the version numbers come from listing the migrations sequentially.

To re-do your migrations from the beginning, AND seed the database:

```
rails db:reset
```

To delete a migration:

```
rails destroy migration NameOfMigration
```

* It is advisable only to delete the final migration, and that that migration has not already been run. This is because successive migrations usually depend on one another.

Shorthand, `destroy` can be written as `d`:

```
rails d migration NameOfMigration
```


<!-- Undoing migrations:

```
rails db:rollback
```

Rolls back the last migration.

To go all the way back to the beginning, we can use

```
rails db:migrate VERSION=0
```

As you might guess, substituting any other number for 0 migrates to that version number, where the version numbers come from listing the migrations sequentially. -->
<!-- 
**Warning:** Migrations often depend on the previous migrations. If you go back in time with your migrations, be very careful what you alter later on in the chain.

To re-run your migrations from the beginning, AND seed the database:

```
rails db:reset
```

Destroy a migration file:

```
rails destroy migration migration_name
```

Destroy a model:

```
rails destroy model model_name
``` -->

## Questions To Think About 🤔

* Rails favors **convention** over **configuration**, what do you think this means?

* The way we have learned migrations, there is an intermediate step between generating a migration and running that migration. What is it and why does that step exist?

* What does running a migration do?

* What is a foreign key used for?

* What is ActiveRecord exactly?
