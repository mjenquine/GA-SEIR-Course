# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# 
# User.create([{ name: "Neff", password: "mighty" }, { name: "Jacc", password: "might" }])
#
# Post.create(title: "one", content: "hiii", user_id: 3)
# Post.create(title: "two", content: "heee", user_id: 4)
Post.create(title: "three", content: "hooo", user_id: 4)
