# FRONTEND APP

Remember, our Rails API is just that, an API. Our Rails server is a giant data farm. This data farm can be made accessible to any client or platform.

For now, we are done with our API. Let's make a frontend that can interact with it.

## &#x1F684; CREATE REACT APP

* Keep your Rails server running.

* On the command line, open new tab. Exit the Rails directory into the parent `noticeboard_app`

* We are going to make a separate _client_ server for our front end. It's not unusual to do so. Imagine a large company like facebook and all the data they manage. They have both a desktop app and a mobile app. These apps share the databases. It would be a lot of duplication to copy all the data over from the desktop to mobile and then update everything everywhere.

In the interest of time, we are going to start with some boilerplate code

- enter the `noticeboard_client folder`
- `npm install`


* `npm start` you may have a conflicting port with your rails app, choose another port when prompted


## Create React App
Create React App does a few really nice things for us. It builds us a server that is tailored to our needs. It does 'hot-reloading' - every time we save we see our changes in the browser update. It also does testing for us and give us helpful messages in the browser console.

Like Rails, Create React App is a bit magical and will handle a lot of things for us behind the scenes. As you continue to grow as developers, you can explore what the different parts of create react app are doing. For now, we'll focus on building something that interacts with our Rails backend.

Remember, we could use any frontend library or framework. (At least, one that can work with HTTP requests). But we'll stick with React


### React Setup

We'll work with a few files: They will be in the `src` folder. But mostly, we'll stay focused on App.js


Let's look at `App.js`



```js
import React from 'react'

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Notices</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```


Now let's customize our `App.js` to be for our app.


We'll render our different components inside our app:

```js
import React from 'react'
import Aside from './components/Aside.js'
import Footer from './components/Footer.js'
import Header from './components/Header.js'
import Main from './components/Main.js'
import Nav from './components/Nav.js'

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      notices: []
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className='container'>
          <Header />
          <Aside />
          <Main notices={this.state.notices}/>
          <Nav />
          <Footer />
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App

```

And that should do it!

We should see our Notices component render in the browser

### React Fetch

Let's make the AJAX request to our Rails server to get data. The data will be an index of all the **notices**. With it, we can make a data-drive app.

Two things to keep in mind:

1. Make sure your Rails server is running.

We know our app is running on locahost:3000 right now, but that could change. We should use relative routes in our app. We can do that by adding a proxy in our `package.json` for our create react app.

```js
{
  "name": "noticeboard_client",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "proxy": "http://localhost:3000",
  "private": true,
```


2. This AJAX request **should not** work. This is due to CORS, a basic security feature. We will talk about CORS specifically later.

NOTE: if you are getting a syntax error of `<` in JSON - try restarting your Create React app (control c then npm start again)

Make a request to the Rails server and console log the response. 

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Notices extends Component {
	constructor(props){
		super(props)
		this.state = {
			notices: []
		}
	}
	componentDidMount() {
		this.getNotices()
	}
	getNotices () {
		fetch('http://localhost:3000/notices')
			.then(response => response.json())
			.then(json => console.log(json))
      .catch(error => console.error(error))
	}
  render () {
    return (
      <h1>Notices</h1>
    )
  }
}

export default Notices;
```

If you get this:

It means your Rails server is not running.

If you get a response like this, then you have the expected CORS issue:

```
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the request resource.
```

> Otherwise, you should see your API data showing up in your browser console. This might happen if somehow your browser is ignoring the `same-origin policy` OR has `localhost:3000` cached already.
>
> Try emptying your cache and see what happens.
